<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">When I send you this volume, I am rather to make
you a request than a Dedication. I must desire,
that if you think fit to throw away any moments on it,
you would not do it after reading those excellent pieces
with which you are usually conversant. The images which
you will meet with here, will be very faint, after the
perusal of the Greeks and Romans, who are your ordinary
companions. I must confess I am obliged to you for the
taste of many of their excellences, which I had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>t
observed until you pointed them to me. I am very proud
that there are some things in these papers which I know
you pardon;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and it is no small pleasure to have one's
labours suffered by the judgment of a man, who so well
understands the true charms of eloquence and poesy. But
I direct this address to you, not that I think I can entertain
you with my writings, but to thank you for the new
delight I have, from your conversation, in those of other
men.</p>

<p>May you enjoy a long continuance of the true relish
of the happiness Heaven has bestowed upon you. I know
not how to say a more affectionate thing to you, than to
wish that you may be always what you are; and that
you may ever think, as I know you now do, that you
have a much larger fortune than you want.</p>

<p>I am, Sir,</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Edward Wortley Montagu, an intimate friend of Addison and
Steele, was the second son of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and
grandson of Edward Montagu, the first Earl of Sandwich. He was
chosen a Member of Parliament for Huntingdon in 1705, and in all
other parliaments but two to the end of her reign. On the accession of
George I. he became one of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury,
and was afterwards Ambassador-Extraordinary to the Porte. He set
out, January 27, 1716, and having finished his negotiations returned
in 1718. In the first parliament called by King George I. he was
chosen for the city of Westminster, and afterwards served for Huntingdon.
He was a member for the city of Peterborough when he died,
January 22, 1761, aged 80 years, before he was able to alter his will,
as he intended, in favour of his son. He married the famous Lady
Mary Pierrepont, eldest daughter of the Duke of Kingston, in 1712,
and by her he had issue an only son, Edward Wortley Montagu, who
was M.P. in three parliaments for Bossiney, in Cornwall; and a
daughter Mary, married to John Stuart, Earl of Bute, August 24,
1736.</p></div>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 2.</i></h3>


<h4><i>The History of Orlando the Fair. Chap. I.</i></h4>

<p class="drop-cap">Whatever malicious men may say of our lucubrations,
we have no design but to produce
unknown merit, or place in a proper light the actions of
our contemporaries who labour to distinguish themselves,
whether it be by vice or virtue. For we shall never give
accounts to the world of anything, but what the lives and
endeavours of the persons (of whom we treat) make the
basis of their fame and reputation. For this reason it is
to be hoped, that our appearance is reputed a publi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>c
benefit; and though certain persons may turn what we
mean for panegyric into scandal, let it be answered once
for all, that if our praises are really designed as raillery,
such malevolent persons owe their safety from it only to
their being too inconsiderable for history. It is not every
man who deals in ratsbane, or is unseasonably amorous, that
can adorn story like &AElig;sculapius;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> nor every stockjobber
of the India Company can assume the port, and personate
the figure of Aurengezebe.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> My noble ancestor, Mr.
Shakespeare, who was of the race of the Staffs, was not
more fond of the memorable Sir John Falstaff, than I am of
those worthies; but the Latins have an admirable admonition
expressed in two words, to wit, <i>nequid nimis</i>, which
forbids my indulging myself on those delightful subjects,
and calls me to do justice to others, who make no less figures
in our generation: of such, the first and most renowned
is, that eminent hero and lover, Orlando<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the handsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>,
whose disappointments in love, in gallantry, and in war, have
banished him from public view, and made him voluntarily
enter into a confinement, to which the ungrateful age
would otherwise have forced him. Ten <i>lustra</i> and more
are wholly passed since Orlando first appeared in the
metropolis of this island: his descent noble, his wit
humorous, his person charming. But to none of these
recommendatory advantages was his title so undoubted as
that of his beauty. His complexion was fair, but his
countenance manly; his stature of the tallest, his shape
the most exact; and though in all his limbs he had a
proportion as delicate as we see in the works of the most
skilful statuaries, his body had a strength and firmness little
inferior to the marble of which such images are formed.
This made Orlando the universal flame of all the fair sex:
innocent virgins sighed for him, as Adonis; experienced
widows, as Hercules. Thus did this figure walk alone the
pattern and ornament of our species, but of course the
envy of all who had the same passions, without his superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>merit and pretences to the favour of that enchanting
creature, woman. However, the generous Orlando believed
himself formed for the world, and not to be engrossed by
any particular affection. He sighed not for Delia, for
Chloris, for Chloe, for Betty, nor my lady, nor for the
ready chambermaid, nor distant baroness: woman was his
mistress, and the whole sex his seraglio. His form was
always irresistible: and if we consider, that not one of
five hundred can bear the least favour from a lady without
being exalted above himself; if also we must allow, that
a smile from a side-box<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> has made Jack Spruce half
mad, we can't think it wonderful that Orlando's repeated
conquests touched his brain: so it certainly did, and
Orlando became an enthusiast in love; and in all his
address, contracted something out of the ordinary course
of breeding and civility. However (powerful as he was),
he would still add to the advantages of his person that of
a profession which the ladies favour, and immediately commenced
soldier. Thus equipped for love and honour, our
hero seeks distant climes and adventures, and leaves the
despairing nymphs of Great Britain to the courtship of
beau and witlings till his return. His exploits in foreign
nations and courts have not been regularly enough communicated
unto us, to report them with that veracity
which we profess in our narrations: but after many feats
of arms (which those who were witnesses to them hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>e
suppressed out of envy, but which we have had faithfully
related from his own mouth in our public streets) Orlando,
returns home full, but not loaded with years. Beau born
in his absence made it their business to decry his furniture,
his dress, his manner; but all such rivalry he suppressed
(as the philosopher did the sceptic, who argued
there was no such thing as motion) by only moving.
The beauteous Villaria,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who only was formed for his
paramour, became the object of his affection. His first
speech to her was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Madam,&mdash;It is not only that nature has made us two
the most accomplished of each sex, and pointed to us to
obey her dictates in becoming one; but that there is also
an ambition in following the mighty persons you have
favoured. Where kings and heroes, as great as Alexander,
or such as could personate Alexander,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> have bowed, permit
your general to lay his laurels."</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Milton:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The fair with conscious majesty approved</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>His pleaded reason;</i><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and fortune had now supplied Orlando with necessarie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>s
for his high taste of gallantry and pleasure: his equipage
and economy had something in them more sumptuous and
gallant than could be received in our degenerate age;
therefore his figure (though highly graceful) appeared so
exotic, that it assembled all the Britons under the age of
sixteen, who saw his grandeur, to follow his chariot with
shouts and acclamations, which he regarded with the contempt
which great minds affect in the midst of applauses.
I remember I had the honour to see him one day stop, and
call the youths about him, to whom he spake as follows:</p>

<p>"Good bastard,&mdash;Go to school, and don't lose your time
in following my wheels: I am loth to hurt you, because
I know not but you are all my own offspring: hark'ee,
you sirrah with the white hair, I am sure you are mine:
there is half-a-crown. Tell your mother, this, with the
half-crown I gave her when I got you, comes to five
shillings. Thou hast cost me all that, and yet thou art
good for nothing. Why, you young dogs, did you never
see a man before?" "Never such a one as you, noble
general," replied a truant from Westminster. "Sirrah, I believe
thee: there is a crown for thee. Drive on, coachman."</p>

<p>This vehicle, though sacred to love, was not adorned
with doves: such an hieroglyphic denoted too languishing
a passion. Orlando therefore gave the eagle,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> as
being of a constitution which inclined him rather to seize
his prey with talons, than pine for it with murmurs.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, August 2.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have received the following letter from Mr. Powell of
the Bath,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> who, I think, runs from the point between
us, which I leave the whole world to judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph3"><i>To Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Having a great deal of more advantageous business
at present on my hands, I thought to have
deferred answering your <i>Tatler</i> of the 21st instant, till the
company was gone, and season over; but having resolved
not to regard any impertinences of your paper, except
what relate particularly to me, I am the more easily
induced to answer you (as I shall find time to do it):
First, partly lest you should think yourself neglected,
which I have reason to believe you would take heinously
ill. Secondly, partly because it will increase my fame,
and consequently my audience, when all the quality shall
see with how much wit and raillery I show you&mdash;I don't
care a farthing for you. Thirdly, partly because, being
without books,<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> if I don't show much learning, it will not
be imputed to my having none.</p>

<p>"I have travelled Italy, France, and Spain, and fully
comprehend what any German artist in the world can do;
yet cannot I imagine, why you should endeavour to disturb
the repose and plenty which (though unworthy) I enjoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>at this place. It cannot be, that you take offence at my
prologues and epilogues, which you are pleased to miscall
foolish and abusive. No, no, until you give a better,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I
shall not forbear thinking, that the true reason of your
picking a quarrel with me was, because it is more agreeable
to your principles, as well as more to the honour of your
assured victory, to attack a governor. Mr. Isaac, Mr.
Isaac, I can see into a millstone as far as another (as the
saying is). You are for sowing the seeds of sedition and
disobedience among my puppets, and your zeal for the
(good old) cause would make you persuade Punch to pull
the string from his chops, and not move his jaw when I
have a mind he should harangue. Now I appeal to all
men, if this is not contrary to that uncontrollable, unaccountable
dominion, which by the laws of nature I exercise
over them; for all sorts of wood and wire were made
for the use and benefit of man: I have therefore an
unquestionable right to frame, fashion, and put them
together, as I please; and, having made them what they
are, my puppets are my property, and therefore my slaves:
nor is there in nature anything more just, than the homage
which is paid by a less to a more excellent being: so that,
by the right therefore of a superior genius, I am their
supreme moderator, although you would insinuate (agreeably
to your levelling principles) that I am myself but a
great puppet, and can therefore have but a co-ordinate
jurisdiction with them. I suppose I have now sufficiently
made it appear, that I have a paternal right<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to keep <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>a
puppet-show, and this right I will maintain in my
prologues on all occasions.</p>

<p>"And therefore, if you write a defence of yourself
against this my self-defence, I admonish you to keep
within bounds; for every day will not be so propitious to
you as the 29th of April; and perhaps my resentment
may get the better of my generosity, and I may no longer
scorn to fight one who is not my equal with unequal
weapons: there are such things as <i>scandalums magnatums</i>;<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
therefore take heed hereafter how you write such
things as I cannot easily answer, for that will put me in a
passion.</p>

<p>"I order you to handle only these two propositions, to
which our dispute may be reduced: the first, whether I
have not an absolute power, whenever I please, to light a
pipe with one of Punch's legs, or warm my fingers with his
whole carcass? The second, whether the devil would
not be in Punch, should he by word or deed oppose my
sovereign will and pleasure? And then, perhaps, I may
(if I can find leisure for it) give you the trouble of a
second letter.</p>

<p>"But if you intend to tell me of the original of puppet-shows,
and the several changes, and revolutions that have
happened in them, since Thespis, and I don't care who,
that's <i>noli me tangere</i>; I have solemnly engaged to say
nothing of what I can't approve. Or, if you talk of
certain contracts with the mayor and burgesses, or fees to
the constables, for the privilege of acting, I will not write
one single word about any such matters;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but shall leav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>e
you to be mumbled by the learned and very ingenious
author of a late book, who knows very well what is to be
said and done in such cases.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> He is now shuffling the
cards, and dealing to Timothy; but if he wins the game,
I will send him to play at backgammon with you; and
then he will satisfy you, that deuce-ace makes five.</p>

<p>"And so, submitting myself to be tried by my country,
and allowing any jury of twelve good men, and true, to be
that country; not excepting any (unless Mr. Isaac Bickerstaff)
to be of the panel,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> for you are neither good nor
true; I bid you heartily farewell; and am,</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Robert Feilding, commonly known by the name of Beau Feilding,
a handsome and very comely gentleman, was tried for felony at the
Old Bailey, December 4, 1706. He had married, as the indictment
sets forth, on November 25, 1705, Barbara, Duchess of Cleveland,
having a former wife then living. In the course of the evidence at
this trial, it appears, that sixteen days before, viz. November 9, 1705,
Mrs. Villars, a very bad woman, had artfully drawn him into a marriage
with one Mary Wadsworth, spinster, in the mistaken belief of her
being Mrs. Deleau, a widow, with a fortune of &pound;60,000. His marriage
with the duchess was therefore set aside, and her Grace was allowed
the liberty of marrying again. He craved the benefit of his clergy,
and when sentence was given, that he should be burnt in his hand,
produced the Queen's warrant to suspend execution, and was admitted
to bail. In his will, dated April 9, 1712, and proved on May 12
following, he is styled "Robert Feilding, of Feilding Hall, in the
county of Warwick, Esq.," and appears to have had some estates at
Lutterworth. He is mentioned by Swift among those who have made
"mean figures" on some remarkable occasions. Feilding, having
injured his fortune by his gallantry and extravagance in early life,
repaired the breaches he had made in it, by his first marriage with the
Countess of Purbeck, a widow lady of an ancient and noble family in
Ireland, who had a large fortune of her own, to which she had added
considerably by a former marriage; she was the only daughter and
heiress of Barnham Swift, Lord Carlingford, who was of the same
family with the Dean of St. Patrick's. Feilding is said to have lived
happily for some years with this lady, who was a zealous Roman
Catholic, and could have no great difficulty in inducing a man who
had no religion to profess himself a proselyte to her religious persuasion.
See No. 51 (Nichols).&mdash;On July 29, 1706, Lady Wentworth wrote to
Lord Raby that the Duchess of Cleveland had got Feilding sent to
Newgate "for threatning to kill her two sons for taking her part, when
he beet her and broke open her closet door and took four hundred
pd. out.... He beat her sadly and she cried out murder in the
street out of the window, and he shot a blunderbuss at the people"
("Wentworth Papers," pp. 58-9). See, too, Luttrell's "Diary," June,
July, and October, 1706, <i>passim</i>.</p></div>

boxes. See, too, the <i>Spectator</i>, Nos. 311, 377. But Swift ("Polite
Conversation," 1738) writes: "Pray, Mr. Neverout, what lady was
that you were talking with in the side box?" A wench in a side-box
was looked upon with suspicion. See Nos. 145, 217. In the
<i>Theatre</i> (No. 3) Steele says: "Three of the fair sex for the front
boxes, two gentlemen of wit and pleasure for the side boxes, and three
substantial citizens for the pit!"</p></div>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 5.</i></h3>


<h4><i>The History of Orlando the Fair.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Chap. II.</i></h4>

<p class="drop-cap">Fortune being now propitious to the gay Orlando,
he dressed, he spoke, he moved, as a man might be
supposed to do in a nation of pigmies, and had an equal
value for our approbation or dislike. It is usual for
those who profess a contempt of the world, to fly from it
and live in obscurity; but Orlando, with a greater
magnanimity, contemned it, and appeared in it to tell
them so. If therefore his exalted mien met with an
unwelcome reception, he was sure always to double the
cause which gave the distaste. You see our beauties
affect a negligence in the ornament of their hair, and
adjusting their head-dresses, as conscious that they adorn
whatever they wear. Orlando had not only this humour
in common with other beauties, but also had a neglect
whether things became him or not, in a world he contemned.
For this reason, a noble particularity appeared
in all his economy, furniture, and equipage. And to
convince the present little race, how unequal all their
measures were to an antediluvian, as he called himself, in
respect of the insects which now appear for men, he
sometimes rode in an open tumbril,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> of less size than
ordinary, to show the largeness of his limbs, and th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>e
grandeur, of his personage, to the greater advantage: at
other seasons, all his appointments had a magnificence, as
if it were formed by the genius of Trimalchio<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of old,
which showed itself in doing ordinary things with an air
of pomp and grandeur.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Orlando therefore called for
tea by beat of drum; his valet got ready to shave him by
a trumpet "To horse"; and water was brought for his
teeth when the sound was changed to "Boots and saddle."</p>

<p>In all these glorious excesses from the common practice,
did the happy Orlando live and reign in an uninterrupted
tranquillity, till an unlucky accident brought to his
remembrance, that one evening he was married before he
courted the nuptials of Villaria.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Several fatal
memorandums were produced to revive the memory of this
accident, and the unhappy lover was for ever banished her
presence, to whom he owed the support of his just renown
and gallantry. But distress does not debase noble minds;
it only changes the scene, and gives them new glory by
that alteration. Orlando therefore now raves in a garret,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and calls to his neighbour-skies to pity his dolors, and
find redress for an unhappy lover. All high spirits, in
any great agitation of mind, are inclined to relieve themselves
by poetry. The renowned porter of Oliver<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> ha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>d
not more volumes around his cell in the College of Bedlam,
than Orlando in his present apartment. And though
inserting poetry in the midst of prose be thought a licence
among correct writers not to be indulged, it is hoped, the
necessity of doing it to give a just idea of the hero of
whom we treat, will plead for the liberty we shall hereafter
take, to print Orlando's soliloquies in verse and prose, after
the manner of great wits, and such as those to whom they
are nearly allied.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, August 5.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A great deal of good company of us were this day to
see, or rather to hear, an artful person<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> do several
feats of activity with his throat and windpipe. The first
thing wherewith he presented us, was a ring of bells,
which he imitated in a most miraculous manner; after
that he gave us all the different notes of a pack of hounds,
to our great delight and astonishment. The company
expressed their applause with much noise; and never was
heard such an harmony of men and dogs: but a certain
plump merry fellow, from an angle of the room, fell a
crowing like a cock so ingeniously, that he won our hearts
from the other operator in an instant. As soon as I saw
him, I recollected I had seen him on the stage, and
immediately knew it to be Tom Mirrour, the comical
actor.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> He immediately addressed himself to me, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>d
told me, he was surprised to see a <i>virtuoso</i> take satisfaction
in any representations below that of human life; and
asked me, whether I thought this acting bells and dogs
was to be considered under the notion of wit, humour, or
satire? "Were it not better," continued he, "to have some
particular picture of man laid before your eyes, that might
incite your laughter?" He had no sooner spoke the word,
but he immediately quitted his natural shape, and talked
to me in a very different air and tone from what he had
used before; upon which all that sat near us laughed; but
I saw no distortion in his countenance, or anything that
appeared to me disagreeable. I asked Pacolet, what
meant that sudden whisper about us? For I could not
take the jest. He answered: "The gentleman you were
talking to, assumed your air and countenance so exactly,
that all fell a laughing to see how little you knew yourself,
or how much you were enamoured with your own image.
But that person," continued my monitor, "if men would
make the right use of him, might be as instrumental to
their reforming errors in gesture, language, and speech,
as a dancing-master, linguist, or orator. You see he laid
yourself before you with so much address, that you saw
nothing particular in his behaviour: he has so happy a
knack of representing errors and imperfections, that you
can bear your faults in him as well as in yourself: he is
the first mimic that ever gave the beauties, as well as the
deformities, of the man he acted. What Mr. Dryden said
of a very great man<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> may be well applied to him:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>He is</i><br />
<i>Not one, but all mankind's epitome.</i>"</h4>

<p class="drop-cap">You are to know, that this pantomime may be said to
be a species of himself. He has no commerce with the
rest of mankind, but as they are the objects of imitation;
like the Indian fowl, called the mock-bird, who has no
note of his own, but hits every sound in the wood as soon
as he hears it; so that Mirrour is at once a copy and an
original. Poor Mirrour's fate (as well as talent) is like
that of the bird we just now spoke of. The nightingale,
the linnet, the lark, are delighted with his company; but
the buzzard, the crow, and the owl, are observed to be his
mortal enemies. Whenever Sophronius meets Mirrour,
he receives him with civility and respect, and well knows,
a good copy of himself can be no injury to him; but
Bathillus shuns the street where he expects to meet him;
for he that knows his every step and look is constrained

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, August 5.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Letters from Coventry and other places have been sent
to me, in answer to what I have said in relation to
my antagonist Mr. Powell,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and advise me, with warm language,
to keep to subjects more proper for me than such
high points. But the writers of these epistles mistake the
use and service I propose to the learned world by such
observations: for you are to understand, that the title of
this paper gives me a right in taking to myself, and inserting
in it, all such parts of any book or letter which are
foreign to the purpose intended, or professed by the writer:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>so that suppose two great divines should argue, and
treat each other with warmth and levity unbecoming their
subject or character, all that they say unfit for that place
is very proper to be inserted here. Therefore from time
to time, in all writings which shall hereafter be published,
you shall have from me extracts of all that shall appear
not to the purpose; and for the benefit of the gentle
reader, I will show what to turn over unread and what to
peruse. For this end I have a mathematical sieve preparing,
in which I will sift every page and paragraph, and all
that falls through I shall make bold with for my own use.
The same thing will be as beneficial in speech; for all
superfluous expressions in talk fall to me also: as, when a
pleader at the Bar designs to be extremely impertinent and
troublesome, and cries, "Under favour of the Court&mdash;&mdash;With
submission, my lord&mdash;&mdash;I humbly offer&mdash;&mdash;" and,
"I think I have well considered this matter; for I would
be very far from trifling with your lordship's time, or trespassing
upon your patience&mdash;&mdash;However, thus I will venture
to say"&mdash;and so forth. Or else, when a sufficiently
self-conceited coxcomb is bringing out something in his
own praise, and begins, "Without vanity, I must take this
upon me to assert." There is also a trick which the fair
sex have, that will greatly contribute to swell my volumes:
as, when a woman is going to abuse her best friend, "Pray,"
says she, "have you heard what I said of Mrs. such a one:
I am heartily sorry to hear anything of that kind, of one
I have so great a value for; but they make no scruple of
telling it; and it was not spoken of to me as a secret, for
now all the town rings of it." All such flowers in rhetoric,
and little refuges for malice, are to be noted, and naturally
belong only to Tatlers. By this method you will immediately
find volumes contract themselves into octavos, and
the labour of a fortnight got over in half a day.</p>

<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, August 5.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Last night arrived a mail from Lisbon, which gives
a very pleasing account of the posture of affairs in
that part of the world, the enemy having been necessitated
wholly to abandon the blockade of Olivenza. These
advices say that Sir John Jennings<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> was arrived at Lisbon.
When that gentleman left Barcelona, his Catholic Majesty
was taking all possible methods for carrying on an
offensive war. It is observed with great satisfaction in
the Court of Spain, that there is a very good intelligence
between the general officers; Count Staremberg and Mr.
Stanhope<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> acting in all things with such unanimity, that the
public affairs receive great advantages from their personal
friendship and esteem to each other, and mutual assistance
in promoting the service of the common cause.</p>

<p>This is to give notice that if any able-bodied Palatine
will enter into the bonds of matrimony with Betty Pepin,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
the said Palatine shall be settled in a freehold of 40s. per

<h4><i>Delamira resigns her Fan.</i><a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></h4>

<p class="drop-cap">Long had the crowd of the gay and young stood in
suspense as to their fate in their passion to the
beauteous Delamira; but all their hopes are lately
vanished by the declaration that she has made of her
choice to take the happy Archibald<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> for her companion
for life. Upon her making this public, the expense of
sweet powder and jessamine<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> are considerably abated; and
the mercers and milliners complain of her want of public
spirit, in not concealing longer a secret which was so much
to the benefit of trade. But so it has happened; and no
one was in confidence with her in carrying on this treaty
but the matchless Virgulta, whose despair of ever entering
the matrimonial state, made her, some nights before Delamira's
resolution was made known to the world, address
herself to her in the following manner:</p>

<p>"Delamira, you are now going into that state of life,
wherein the use of your charms is wholly to be applied t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>o
the pleasing only one man. That swimming air of your
body; that jaunty bearing of your head over one shoulder;
and that inexpressible beauty in your manner of playing
your fan, must be lowered into a more confined behaviour,
to show that you would rather shun than receive addresses
in the future. Therefore, dear Delamira, give me those
excellences you leave, and acquaint me with your manner
of charming. For I take the liberty of our friendship to
say, that when I consider my own stature, motion, complexion,
wit or breeding, I cannot think myself any way
your inferior; yet do I go through crowds without
wounding a man, and all my acquaintance marry round me,
while I live a virgin unasked, and (I think) unregarded."</p>

<p>Delamira heard her with great attention, and with that
dexterity which is natural to her, told her, that all she had
above the rest of her sex and contemporary beauties was
wholly owing to a fan<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> (which was left her by her mother,
and had been long in the family), which whoever had in
possession, and used with skill, should command the hearts
of all her beholders: "And since," said she, smiling, "I have
no more to do with extending my conquests or triumphs,
I'll make you a present of this inestimable rarity." Virgulta
made her expressions of the highest gratitude for so uncommon
a confidence in her, and desired she would show
her what was peculiar in the management of that utensil,
which rendered it of such general force while she was
mistress of it. Delamira replied, "You see, madam, Cupid
is the principal figure painted on it; and the skill in
playing this fan is, in several motions of it, to let him
appear as little as possible; for honourable lovers fly al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>l
endeavours to ensnare them; and your Cupid must hide
his bow and arrow, or he'll never be sure of his game.
You may observe," continued she, "that in all public assemblies,
the sexes seem to separate themselves, and draw up
to attack each other with eyeshot: that is the time when
the fan, which is all the armour of woman, is of most use
in our defence; for our minds are construed by the waving
of that little instrument, and our thoughts appear in composure
or agitation according to the motion of it. You
may observe, when Will Peregrine comes into the side-box,<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Miss Gatty flutters her fan<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> as a fly does its wings
round a candle; while her elder sister, who is as much in
love with him as she is, is as grave as a vestal at his entrance,
and the consequence is accordingly. He watches half the play
for a glance from her sister, while Gatty is overlooked
and neglected. I wish you heartily as much success in
the management of it as I have had: if you think fit to
go on where I left off, I will give you a short account of
the execution I have made with it. Cymon, who is the
dullest of mortals, and though a wonderful great scholar,
does not only pause, but seems to take a nap with his eyes
open between every other sentence in his discourse: him
have I made a leader in assemblies; and one blow on the
shoulder as I passed by him, has raised him to a downright
impertinent in all conversations. The airy Will Sampler
is become as lethargic by this my wand, as Cymon is
sprightly. Take it, good girl, and use it without mercy;
for the reign of beauty never lasted full three years, but it
ended in marriage, or condemnation to virginity. As
you fear therefore the one, and hope for the other, I expec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>t
an hourly journal of your triumphs; for I have it by
certain tradition, that it was given to the first who wore it
by an enchantress, with this remarkable power, that it
bestows a husband in half a year to her who does not
overlook her proper minute; but assigns to a long despair
the woman who is well offered, and neglects that proposal.
May occasion attend your charms, and your charms
slip no occasion. Give me, I say, an account of the progress
of your forces at our next meeting; and you shall
hear what I think of my new condition. I should meet
my future spouse this moment. Farewell. Live in just
terror of the dreadful words, <span class="smcap">SHE WAS</span>."</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, August 8.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I had the honour this evening to visit some ladies, where
the subject of the conversation was Modesty, which
they commended as a quality quite as becoming in men
as in women. I took the liberty to say, it might be
as beautiful in our behaviour as in theirs; yet it could not
be said, it was as successful in life; for as it was the only
recommendation in them, so it was the greatest obstacle
to us both in love and business. A gentleman present
was of my mind, and said, that we must describe the
difference between the modesty of women and that of
men, or we should be confounded in our reasonings upon
it; for this virtue is to be regarded with respect to our
different ways of life. The woman's province is to be
careful in her economy, and chaste in her affection: the
man's to be active in the improvement of his fortune, and
ready to undertake whatever is consistent with his reputation
for that end. Modesty therefore in a woman has a
certain agreeable fear in all she enters upon; and in men
it is composed of a right judgment of what is proper for
them to attempt. From hence it is, that a discreet man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
is always a modest one. It is to be noted that modesty
in a man is never to be allowed as a good quality, but a
weakness, if it suppresses his virtue, and hides it from the
world, when he has at the same time a mind to exert himself.
A French author says very justly, that modesty is
to the other virtues in a man, what shade in a picture is to
the parts of the thing represented: it makes all the
beauties conspicuous which would otherwise be but a wild
heap of colours. This shade on our actions must therefore
be very justly applied; for if there be too much,
it hides our good qualities, instead of showing them to
advantage. Nestor<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> in Athens was an unhappy instance
of this truth; for he was not only in his profession the
greatest man of that age, but had given more proofs of
it than any other man ever did; yet for want of that
natural freedom and audacity which is necessary in commerce
with men, his personal modesty overthrew all his
public actions. Nestor was in those days a skilful architect,
and in a manner the inventor of the use of mechanic
powers, which he brought to so great perfection that he
knew to an atom what foundation would bear such a
superstructure: and they record of him that he was so
prodigiously exact that for the experiment-sake he built
an edifice of great beauty, and seeming strength; but contrived
so as to bear only its own parts, and not to admit
the addition of the least particle. This building was
beheld with much admiration by all the <i>virtuosi</i> of that
time; but fell down with no other pressure but the settling
of a wren upon the top of it.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But Nestor's modesty wa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>s
such that his art and skill were soon disregarded for want
of that manner with which men of the world support and
assert the merit of their own performances. Soon after this
example of his art Athens was, by the treachery of its
enemies, burnt to the ground. This gave Nestor the
greatest occasion that ever builder had to render his name
immortal, and his person venerable: for all the new city
rose according to his disposition, and all the monuments
of the glories and distresses of that people were erected
by that sole artist. Nay, all their temples, as well as
houses, were the effects of his study and labour; insomuch,
that it was said by an old sage, "Sure, Nestor will now be
famous; for the habitations of gods, as well as men, are
built by his contrivance." But this bashful quality still
put a damp upon his great knowledge, which has as fatal
an effect upon men's reputation as poverty; for as it was
said, the poor man saved the city, and the poor man's
labour was forgot; so here we see, the modest man built
the city, and the modest man's skill was unknown.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Thus
we see every man is the maker of his own fortune; and
what is very odd to consider, he must in some measure be
the trumpet of his fame: not that men are to be tolerated
who directly praise themselves, but they are to be endue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>d
with a sort of defensive eloquence, by which they shall be
always capable of expressing the rules and arts by which
they govern themselves. Varillus was the man of all I
have read of the happiest in the true possession of this
quality of modesty. My author says of him, Modesty
in Varillus is really a virtue; for it is a voluntary quality,
and the effect of good sense. He is naturally bold and
enterprising; but so justly discreet, that he never acts or
speaks anything, but those who behold him know he has
forborne much more than he has performed or uttered,
out of deference to the persons before whom he is. This
makes Varillus truly amiable, and all his attempts successful;
for as bad as the world is thought to be by those
who are perhaps unskilled in it, want of success in our
actions is generally owing to want of judgment in what
we ought to attempt, or a rustic modesty which will not
give us leave to undertake what we ought. But how
unfortunate this diffident temper is to those who are
possessed with it may be best seen in the success of
such as are wholly unacquainted with it. We have one
peculiar elegance in our language above all others, which
is conspicuous in the term "fellow." This word added
to any of our adjectives extremely varies, or quite alters
the sense of that with which it is joined. Thus, though a
modest man is the most unfortunate of all men, yet a
modest fellow is as superlatively happy. A modest fellow
is a ready creature, who with great humility, and as great
forwardness, visits his patrons at all hours, and meets
them in all places, and has so moderate an opinion of
himself, that he makes his court at large. If you won't
give him a great employment, he will be glad of a little
one. He has so great a deference for his benefactor's
judgment, that as he thinks himself fit for anything he
can get, so he is above nothing which is offered; like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
young bachelor of arts, who came to town recommended
to a chaplain's place; but none being vacant, modestly
accepted of that of a postillion. We have very many
conspicuous persons of this undertaking yet modest turn;
I have a grandson who is very happy in this quality: I
sent him at the time of the last peace into France. As
soon as he landed at Calais, he sent me an exact account of
the nature of the people, and the policies of the King of
France. I got him since chosen a member of a corporation:
the modest creature, as soon as he came into the
Common Council, told a senior burgess, he was perfectly
out in the orders of their house. In other circumstances,
he is so thoroughly modest a fellow, that he seems to pretend
only to things he understands. He is a citizen only
at Court, and in the city a courtier. In a word, to speak
the characteristical difference between a modest man and
a modest fellow; the modest man is in doubt in all his
actions; a modest fellow never has a doubt from his
cradle to his grave.</p>

There was likewise another model of St. Paul's, to which Sir Christopher

That life passed between them after this manner, is th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>e
reason that the town has just now received a lady with
all that gaiety, after having been a relict but three months,
which other women hardly assume under fifteen after such
a disaster. Elmira is the daughter of a rich and worthy
citizen, who gave her to Osmyn with a portion which
might have obtained her an alliance with our noblest
houses, and fixed her in the eye of the world, where her
story had not been now to be related: for her good
qualities had made her the object of universal esteem
among the polite part of mankind, from whom she has
been banished and immured till the death of her gaoler.
It is now full fifteen years since that beauteous lady was
given into the hands of the happy Osmyn, who in the
sense of all the world received at that time a present
more valuable than the possession of both the Indies.
She was then in her early bloom, with an understanding
and discretion very little inferior to the most experienced
matrons. She was not beholden to the charms of her sex,
that her company was preferable to any Osmyn could
meet with abroad; for were all she said considered, without
regard to her being a woman, it might stand the
examination of the severest judges: for she had all the
beauty of her own sex, with all the conversation-accomplishments
of ours. But Osmyn very soon grew surfeited
with the charms of her person by possession, and of her
mind by want of taste; for he was one of that loose sort
of men, who have but one reason for setting any value on
the fair sex, who consider even brides but as new women,
and consequently neglect them when they cease to be such.
All the merit of Elmira could not prevent her becoming
a mere wife within few months after her nuptials; and
Osmyn had so little relish for her conversation, that he
complained of the advantages of it. "My spouse," said he
to one of his companions, "is so very discreet, so good,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
so virtuous, and I know not what, that I think her
person is rather the object of esteem than of love; and
there is such a thing as a merit, which causes rather distance
than passion." But there being no medium in the
state of matrimony, their life began to take the usual
gradations to become the most irksome of all beings.
They grew in the first place very complaisant; and having
at heart a certain knowledge that they were indifferent to
each other, apologies were made for every little circumstance
which they thought betrayed their mutual coldness.
This lasted but few months, when they showed a difference
of opinion in every trifle; and as a sign of certain decay
of affection, the word "perhaps" was introduced in all their
discourse. "I have a mind to go to the Park," says she;
"but perhaps, my dear, you will want the coach on some
other occasion." He would very willingly carry her to
the play; but perhaps, she had rather go to Lady Centaur's<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
and play at ombre.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> They were both persons of good
discerning, and soon found that they mortally hated each
other, by their manner of hiding it. Certain it is, that
there are some genios which are not capable of pure
affection, and a man is born with talents for it as much
as for poetry or any other science. Osmyn began too
late to find the imperfection of his own heart, and used
all the methods in the world to correct it, and argue himself
into return of desire and passion for his wife, by the
contemplation of her excellent qualities, his great obligations
to her, and the high value he saw all the world
except himself did put upon her. But such is man's
unhappy condition, that though the weakness of the heart
has a prevailing power over the strength of the head, ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>t
the strength of the head has but small force against the
weakness of the heart. Osmyn therefore struggled in
vain to revive departed desire; and therefore resolved to
retire to one of his estates in the country, and pass away
his hours of wedlock by the noble diversions of the
field; and in the fury of a disappointed lover, made an
oath, to leave neither stag, fox, nor hare living, during the
days of his wife. Besides that country sports would be
an amusement, he hoped also, that his spouse would be
half killed by the very sense of seeing this town no more,
and would think her life ended as soon as she left it.
He communicated his design to Elmira, who received it
(as now she did all things) like a person too unhappy to
be relieved or afflicted by the circumstance of place. This
unexpected resignation made Osmyn resolve to be as
obliging to her as possible; and if he could not prevail
upon himself to be kind, he took a resolution at least to
act sincerely, and to communicate frankly to her the
weakness of his temper, to excuse the indifference of his
behaviour. He disposed his household in the way to
Rutland, so as he and his lady travelled only in the coach
for the convenience of discourse. They had not gone
many miles out of town, when Osmyn spoke to this
purpose:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"My dear, I believe I look quite as silly, now I am
going to tell you I do not love you, as when I first told
you I did. We are now going into the country together,
with only one hope for making this life agreeable, survivorship:
desire is not in our power; mine is all gone
for you. What shall we do to carry it with decency to
the world, and hate one another with discretion?"</p></blockquote>

<p>The lady answered without the least observation on
the extravagance of his speech:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"My dear, you have lived most of your days in a Court,
and I have not been wholly unacquainted with that sort
of life. In Courts, you see good-will is spoken with great
warmth, ill will covered with great civility. Men are long
in civilities to those they hate, and short in expressions of
kindness to those they love. Therefore, my dear, let us
be well-bred still, and it is no matter, as to all who see
us, whether we love or hate: and to let you see how
much you are beholden to me for my conduct, I have both
hated and despised you, my dear, this half year; and yet
neither in language nor behaviour has it been visible but
that I loved you tenderly. Therefore, as I know you go
out of town to divert life in pursuit of beasts, and
conversation with men just above them; so, my life, from
this moment, I shall read all the learned cooks who have
ever writ, study broths, plaisters, and conserves, till from
a fine lady I become a notable woman. We must take
our minds a note or two lower, or we shall be tortured by
jealousy or anger. Thus I am resolved to kill all keen
passions by employing my mind on little subjects, and
lessening the easiness of my spirit; while you, my dear,
with much ale, exercise, and ill company, are so good as
to endeavour to be as contemptible as it is necessary for
my quiet I should think you."</p>

<p>To Rutland they arrived, and lived with great, but
secret impatience for many successive years, till Osmyn
thought of a happy expedient to give their affairs a new
turn. One day he took Elmira aside, and spoke as
follows:</p>

<p>"My dear, you see here the air is so temperate and
serene, the rivulets, the groves, and soil, so extremely kind
to nature, that we are stronger and firmer in our health
since we left the town; so that there is no hope of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
release in this place: but if you will be so kind as to go
with me to my estate in the Hundreds of Essex, it is
possible some kind damp may one day or other relieve us.
If you will condescend to accept of this offer, I will add
that whole estate to your jointure in this county."</p>

<p>Elmira, who was all goodness, accepted the offer,
removed accordingly, and has left her spouse in that place
to rest with his fathers.</p>

<p>This is the real figure in which Elmira ought to be
beheld in this town, and not thought guilty of an
indecorum, in not professing the sense, or bearing the
habit of sorrow, for one who robbed her of all the
endearments of life, and gave her only common civility,
instead of complacency of manners, dignity of passion,
and that constant assemblage of soft desires and affections
which all feel who love, but none can express.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, August 10.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Mr. Truman, who is a mighty admirer of dramatic
poetry, and knows I am about a tragedy, never meets
me, but he is giving admonitions and hints for my
conduct. "Mr. Bickerstaff," said he, "I was reading last
night your second act you were so kind to lend me; but
I find you depend mightily upon the retinue of your hero
to make him magnificent. You make guards, and
ushers, and courtiers, and commons, and nobles, march
before, and then enters your prince, and says they can't
defend him from his love. Why, prithee Isaac, who ever
thought they could? Place me your loving monarch in
a solitude; let him have no sense at all of his grandeur,
but let it be eaten up with his passion. He must value
himself as the greatest of lovers, not as the first of princes:
and then let him say a more tender thing than ever man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
said before&mdash;for his feather and eagle's beak is nothing at
all. The man is to be expressed by his sentiments and
affections, and not by his fortune or equipage. You are
also to take care, that at his first entrance he says something
which may give us an idea of what we are to expect
in a person of his way of thinking. Shakespeare is your
pattern."<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> In the tragedy of "C&aelig;sar," he introduces his
hero in his nightgown. He had at that time all the
power of Rome: deposed consuls, subordinate generals,
and captive princes, might have preceded him; but his
genius was above such mechanic methods of showing
greatness. Therefore he rather presents that great soul
debating upon the subject of life and death with his
intimate friends, without endeavouring to prepossess his
audience with empty show and pomp. When those who
attend him talk of the many omens which had appeared
that day, he answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cowards die many times before their deaths;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The valiant never taste of death but once.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It seems to me most strange that men should fear;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Seeing that death, a necessary end,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Will come, when it will come.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the hero has spoken this sentiment, there is
nothing that is great which cannot be expected, from one
whose first position is the contempt of death to so high a
degree, as making his exit a thing wholly indifferent, and
not a part of his care, but that of heaven and fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, August 10.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Letters from Brussels of the 15th instant, N.S., say, that
Major-General Ravignan returned on the 8th with
the French king's answer to the intended capitulation for
the citadel of Tournay; which is, that he does not think
fit to sign that capitulation, except the Allies will grant a
cessation of arms in general, during the time in which all
acts of hostility were to have ceased between the citadel
and the besiegers. Soon after the receipt of this news,
the cannon on each side began to play. There are two
attacks against the citadel, commanded by General Lottum
and General Schuylemberg, which are both carried on with
great success; and it is not doubted but the citadel will
be in the hands of the Allies before the last day of this
month. Letters from Ipres say, that on the 9th instant,
part of the garrison of that place had mutinied in two
bodies, each consisting of two hundred; who being
dispersed the same day, a body of eight hundred appeared
in the market-place at nine the night following, and seized
all manner of provisions; but were with much difficulty
quieted. The governor has not punished any of the
offenders, the dissatisfaction being universal in that place;
and it is thought, the officers foment those disorders;
that the Ministry may be convinced of the necessity of
paying those troops, and supplying them with provisions.
These advices add, that on the 14th the Marquis d'Este
passed express through Brussels from the Duke of Savoy,
with advice, that the army of his royal highness had
forced the retrenchments of the enemy in Savoy, and
defeated that body of men which guarded those passes
under the command of the Marquis de Thouy.</p>

<h4><i>Of the Government of Affection.</i><a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></h4>

<p class="drop-cap">When labour was pronounced to be the portion of
man, that doom reached the affections of his
mind, as well as his person, the matter on which he was
to feed, and all the animal and vegetable world about
him. There is therefore an assiduous care and cultivation
to be bestowed upon our passions and affections; for they,
as they are the excrescences of our souls, like our hair and
beards, look horrid or becoming, as we cut or let them
grow. All this grave preface is meant to assign a reason
in nature for the unaccountable behaviour of Duumvir,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
the husband and keeper. Ten thousand follies had this
unhappy man escaped, had he made a compact with himself
to be upon his guard, and not permitted his vagrant
eye to let in so many different inclinations upon him, as
all his days he has been perplexed with. But indeed at
present he has brought himself to be confined only to one
prevailing mistress; between whom and his wife, Duumvi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>r
passes his hours in all the vicissitudes which attend passion
and affection, without the intervention of reason. Laura
his wife, and Phyllis his mistress, are all with whom he
has had, for some months, the least amorous commerce.
Duumvir has passed the noon of life; but cannot withdraw
from those entertainments which are pardonable
only before that stage of our being, and which after that
season are rather punishments than satisfaction: for palled
appetite is humorous, and must be gratified with sauces
rather than food. For which end Duumvir is provided
with an haughty, imperious, expensive, and fantastic mistress,
to whom he retires from the conversation of an
affable, humble, discreet, and affectionate wife. Laura
receives him after absence with an easy and unaffected
complacency; but that he calls insipid: Phyllis rates him
for his absence, and bids him return from whence he
came: this he calls spirit and fire. Laura's gentleness is
thought mean; Phyllis' insolence, sprightly. Were you to
see him at his own home, and his mistress's lodgings, to
Phyllis he appears an obsequious lover, to Laura an
imperious master. Nay, so unjust is the taste of Duumvir,
that he owns Laura has no ill quality, but that she is his
wife; Phyllis no good one, but that she is his mistress.
And he has himself often said, were he married to any one
else, he would rather keep Laura than any woman living;
yet allows at the same time, that Phyllis, were she a woman
of honour, would have been the most insipid animal
breathing. The other day Laura, who has a voice like
an angel, began to sing to him: "Fie, madam," he cried,
"we must be past all these gaieties." Phyllis has a note as
rude and as loud as that of a milkmaid: when she begins
to warble, "Well," says he, "there is such a pleasing
simplicity in all that wench does." In a word, the
affectionate part of his heart being corrupted, and his true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
taste that way wholly lost, he has contracted a prejudice
to all the behaviour of Laura, and a general partiality in
favour of Phyllis. It is not in the power of the wife to do
a pleasing thing, nor in the mistress to commit one that
is disagreeable. There is something too melancholy in the
reflection on this circumstance to be the subject of raillery.
He said a sour thing to Laura at dinner the other day;
upon which she burst into tears. "What the devil,
madam," says he, "can't I speak in my own house?"
He answered Phyllis a little abruptly at supper the same
evening; upon which she threw his periwig into the fire.
"Well," said he, "thou art a brave termagant jade; do
you know, hussy, that fair wig cost forty guineas?"
O Laura! is it for this that the faithful Chromius
sighed for you in vain? How is thy condition altered,
since crowds of youth hung on thy eye, and watched its
glances? It is not many months since Laura was the
wonder and pride of her own sex, as well as the desire and
passion of ours. At plays and at balls, the just turn of
her behaviour, the decency of her virgin charms, chastised,
yet added to diversions. At public devotions, her winning
modesty, her resigned carriage, made virtue and religion
appear with new ornaments, and in the natural apparel of
simplicity and beauty. In ordinary conversations, a sweet
conformity of manners, and a humility which heightened
all the complacencies of good breeding and education,
gave her more slaves than all the pride of her sex ever
made woman wish for. Laura's hours are now spent in
the sad reflections on her choice, and that deceitful vanity
(almost inseparable from the sex) of believing, she could
reclaim one that had so often ensnared others; as it now
is, it is not even in the power of Duumvir himself to do
her justice: for though beauty and merit are things real,
and independent on taste and opinion, yet agreeableness is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
arbitrary, and the mistress has much the advantage of the
wife. But whenever fate is so kind to her and her spouse
as to end her days, with all this passion for Phyllis, and
indifference for Laura, he has a second wife in view, who
may avenge the injuries done to her predecessor. Aglaura
is the destined lady, who has lived in assemblies, has
ambition and play for her entertainment, and thinks of a
man, not as the object of love, but the tool of her interest
or pride. If ever Aglaura comes to the empire of this
inconstant, she will endear the memory of her predecessor.
But in the meantime, it is melancholy to consider, that
the virtue of a wife is like the merit of a poet, never
justly valued till after death.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, August 11.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">As we have professed, that all the actions of men are
our subject, the most solemn are not to be omitted, if
there happen to creep into their behaviour anything
improper for such occasions. Therefore the offence
mentioned in the following epistles (though it may seem
to be committed in a place sacred from observation) is
such, that it is our duty to remark upon it; for though
he who does it is himself only guilty of an indecorum,
he occasions a criminal levity in all others who are present
at it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Bickerstaff</span>,</p>

<p>"It being mine, as well as the opinion of many others,
that your papers are extremely well fitted to reform
any irregular or indecent practice, I present the following
as one which requires your correction. Myself, and a
great many good people who frequent the divine service
at St. Paul's, have been a long time scandalised by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
imprudent conduct of Stentor<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> in that cathedral. This
gentleman, you must know, is always very exact and
zealous in his devotion, which, I believe, nobody blames;
but then he is accustomed to roar and bellow so terribly
loud in the responses, that he frightens even us of the
congregation, who are daily used to him; and one of our
petty canons, a punning Cambridge scholar,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> calls his way
of worship, a bull offering. His harsh untunable pipe
is no more fit than a raven's to join with the music of
a choir; yet nobody having been enough his friend, I
suppose, to inform him of it, he never fails, when present,
to drown the harmony of every hymn and anthem, by an
inundation of sound beyond that of the bridge at the
ebb of the tide, or the neighbouring lions in the anguish
of their hunger. This is a grievance which, to my certain
knowledge, several worthy people desire to see redressed;
and if by inserting this epistle in your paper, or by
representing the matter your own way, you can convince
Stentor, that discord in a choir is the same sin that schism
is in the Church in general, you would lay a great
obligation upon us, and make some atonement for certain
of your paragraphs which have not been highly approved
by us. I am,</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>
<p class="center">Your most humble Servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jeoffry Chanticleer.</span></p>

<p>"St. Paul's Churchyard, <i>August 11</i>."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>It is wonderful there should be such a general lamentation,
and the grievance so frequent, and yet the offender never
know anything of it. I have received the following letter
from my kinsman at the Heralds' Office, near the same place:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"This office, which has had its share in the impartial
justice of your censures, demands at present your
vindication of their rights and privileges. There are
certain hours when our young heralds are exercised in the
faculties of making proclamation, and other vociferations,
which of right belong to us only to utter: but at the
same hours, Stentor in St. Paul's Church, in spite of the
coaches, carts, London cries, and all other sounds between
us, exalts his throat to so high a key, that the most noisy
of our order is utterly unheard. If you please to observe
upon this, you will ever oblige, &amp;c."</p></blockquote>

<p>There have been communicated to me some other ill
consequences from the same cause; as, the overturning of
coaches by sudden starts of the horses as they passed that
way, women pregnant frightened, and heirs to families
lost; which are public disasters, though arising from a
good intention: but it is hoped, after this admonition,
that Stentor will avoid an act of so great supererogation,
as singing without a voice.</p>

<p>But I am diverted from prosecuting Stentor's reformation,
by an account, that the two faithful lovers, Lysander
and Coriana, are dead; for no longer ago than the 1st of
the last month they swore eternal fidelity to each other,
and to love till death. Ever since that time, Lysander has
been twice a day at the chocolate-house, visits in every
circle, is missing four hours in four and twenty, and will
give no account of himself. These are undoubted proofs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of the departure of a lover; and consequently Coriana is
also dead as a mistress. I have written to Stentor to give
this couple three calls at the church door, which they must
hear if they are living within the bills of mortality; and
if they do not answer at that time, they are from that
moment added to the number of my defunct.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 15.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">While others are busied in relations which concern the
interests of princes, the peace of nations, and
revolutions of empire, I think (though these are very
large subjects) my theme of discourse is sometimes to be
of matters of a yet higher consideration. The slow steps
of Providence and Nature, and strange events which are
brought about in an instant, are what, as they come within
our view and observation, shall be given to the public.
Such things are not accompanied with show and noise,
and therefore seldom draw the eyes of the unattentive
part of mankind; but are very proper at once to exercise
our humanity, please our imaginations, and improve our
judgments. It may not therefore be unuseful to relate
many circumstances, which were observable upon a late
cure done upon a young gentleman who was born blind,
and on the 29th of June last received his sight at the age
of twenty years, by the operation of an oculist. This
happened no farther off than Newington, and the wor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>k
was prepared for in the following manner: The operator,
Mr. Grant,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> having observed the eyes of his patient, and
convinced his friends and relations, among others the
Rev. Mr. Caswell, minister of the place, that it was highl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>y
probable he should remove the obstacle which prevented
the use of his sight; all his acquaintance, who had any
regard for the young man, or curiosity to be present when
one of full age and understanding received a new sense,
assembled themselves on this occasion. Mr. Caswell<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
being a gentleman particularly curious, desired the whole
company, in case the blindness should be cured, to keep
silence, and let the patient make his own observations,
without the direction of anything he had received by his
other senses, or the advantage of discovering his friends
by their voices. Among several others, the mother,
brethren, sisters, and a young gentlewoman for whom he
had a passion, were present. The work was performed
with great skill and dexterity. When the patient first
received the dawn of light, there appeared such an ecstasy
in his action, that he seemed ready to swoon away in the
surprise of joy and wonder. The surgeon stood before
him with his instruments in his hand. The young ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>n
observed him from head to foot; after which he surveyed
himself as carefully, and seemed to compare him to
himself; and observing both their hands, seemed to think
they were exactly alike, except the instruments, which he
took for parts of his hands. When he had continued in
this amazement some time, his mother could not longer
bear the agitations of so many passions as thronged upon
her, but fell upon his neck, crying out, "My son! my
son!" The youth knew her voice, and could speak no
more than, "Oh me! are you my mother?" and fainted.
The whole room, you will easily conceive, were very
affectionately employed in recovering him; but above all,
the young gentlewoman who loved him, and whom he
loved, shrieked in the loudest manner. That voice
seemed to have a sudden effect upon him as he recovered,
and he showed a double curiosity in observing her as she
spoke and called to him; till at last he broke out,
"What has been done to me? Whither am I carried?
Is all this about me, the thing I have heard so often of?
Is this the light? Is this seeing? Were you always thus
happy, when you said you were glad to see each other?
Where is Tom, who used to lead me? But I could now,
methinks, go anywhere without him." He offered to
move, but seemed afraid of everything around him.
When they saw his difficulty, they told him, till he
became better acquainted with his new being, he must
let the servant still lead him. The boy was called for, and
presented to him. Mr. Caswell asked him, what sort of
thing he took Tom to be before he had seen him. He
answered, he believed there was not so much of him as
of himself; but he fancied him the same sort of creature.
The noise of this sudden change made all the neighbourhood
throng to the place where he was. As he saw the
crowd thickening, he desired Mr. Caswell to tell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
how many there were in all to be seen. The gentleman,
smiling, answered him, that it would be very proper for
him to return to his late condition, and suffer his eyes
to be covered, till they had received strength; for he
might remember well enough, that by degrees he had
from little and little come to the strength he had at
present in his ability of walking and moving; and that it
was the same thing with his eyes, which, he said, would
lose the power of continuing to him that wonderful
transport he was now in, except he would be contented to
lay aside the use of them, till they were strong enough to
bear the light without so much feeling, as he knew he
underwent at present. With much reluctance he was
prevailed upon to have his eyes bound, in which condition
they kept him in a dark room, till it was proper to let
the organ receive its objects without further precaution.
During the time of this darkness, he bewailed himself in
the most distressed manner, and accused all his friends,
complaining, that some incantation had been wrought
upon him, and some strange magic used to deceive him
into an opinion, that he had enjoyed what they called
sight. He added, that the impressions then let in upon
his soul would certainly distract him, if he were not so at
that present. At another time he would strive to name
the persons he had seen among the crowd after he was
couched, and would pretend to speak (in perplexed terms
of his own making) of what he in that short time observed,
But on the 6th instant it was thought fit to unbind his
head, and the young woman whom he loved was instructed
to open his eyes accordingly, as well to endear herself to
him by such a circumstance, as to moderate his ecstasies by
the persuasion of a voice, which had so much power over
him as hers ever had. When this beloved young woman
began to restore him, she talked to him as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. William, I am now taking the binding off,
though when I consider what I am doing, I tremble with
the apprehension, that (though I have from my very
childhood loved you, dark as you were, and though you
had conceived so strong a love for me) yet you will find
there is such a thing as beauty, which may ensnare you
into a thousand passions of which you now are innocent,
and take you from me for ever. But before I put myself
to that hazard, tell me in what manner that love you
always professed to me entered into your heart; for its
usual admission is at the eyes."</p>

<p>The young man answered, "Dear Lydia, if I am to lose
by sight the soft pantings which I have always felt when I
heard your voice; if I am no more to distinguish the
step of her I love when she approaches me, but to change
that sweet and frequent pleasure for such an amazement
as I knew the little time I lately saw: or if I am to have
anything besides, which may take from me the sense I
have of what appeared most pleasing to me at that time
(which apparition it seems was you): pull out these eyes,
before they lead me to be ungrateful to you, or undo
myself. I wished for them but to see you; pull them
out, if they are to make me forget you."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Lydia was extremely satisfied with these assurances;
and pleased herself with playing with his perplexities. In
all his talk to her, he showed but very faint ideas of
anything which had not been received at the ear; and
closed his protestation to her by saying, that if he were
to see Valentia and Barcelona, whom he supposed the
most esteemed of all women, by the quarrel there was
about them, he would never like any but Lydia.</p>

<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, August 15.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">We have repeated advices of the entire defeat of the
Swedish army near Pultowa<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> on the 27th June, O.S.,
and letters from Berlin give the following account of the
remains of the Swedish army since the battle: Prince
Menzikoff being ordered to pursue the victory, came up
with the Swedish army (which was left to the command of
General Lewenhaupt) on the 30th of June, O.S., on the
banks of the Boristhenes; whereupon he sent General
Lewenhaupt a summons to submit to his present fortune:
Lewenhaupt immediately despatched three general officers
to that prince, to treat about a capitulation; but the
Swedes, though they consisted of 15,000 men, were in so
great want of provision and ammunition, that they were
obliged to surrender themselves at discretion. His
Czarish Majesty despatched an express to General Goltz,
with an account of these particulars, and also with
instructions to send out detachments of his cavalry to
prevent the King of Sweden's joining his army in Poland.
That prince made his escape with a small party by
swimming over the Boristhenes; and it was thought, he
designed to retire into Poland by the way of Volhinia.
Advices from Berne of the 11th instant say, that the
General Diet of the Helvetic Body held at Baden
concluded on the 6th; but the deputies of the six
cantons, who are deputed to determine the affair of
Tockenburg, continue their application to that business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>,
notwithstanding some new difficulties started by the
Abbot of St. Gall. Letters from Geneva of the 9th say,
that the Duke of Savoy's cavalry had joined Count Thaun,
as had also two Imperial regiments of hussars; and that
his royal highness's army was disposed in the following
manner: the troops under the command of Count Thaun
are extended from Constans to St. Peter de Albigni.
Small parties are left in several posts from thence to
Little St. Bernard, to preserve the communication with
Piedmont by the Valley of Aosta. Some forces are also
posted at Taloir, and in the Castle of Doin, on each side
of the Lake of Anneci. General Rhebinder is encamped
in the Valley of Oulx with 10,000 foot, and some
detachments of horse: his troops are extended from
Exilles to Mount Genevre, so that he may easily penetrate
into Dauphine on the least motion of the enemy; but the
Duke of Berwick takes all necessary precautions to
prevent such an enterprise. That General's headquarters
are at Francin; and he hath disposed his army in several
parties, to preserve a communication with the Maurienne
and Brian&ccedil;on. He hath no provisions for his army but
from Savoy; Provence and Dauphine being unable to
supply him with necessaries. He left two regiments of
dragoons at Annen, who suffered very much in the late
action at Tessons, where they lost 1500 who were killed
on the spot, 4 standards, and 300 prisoners, among whom
were 40 officers. The last letters from the Duke of
Marlborough's camp at Orchies of the 19th instant advise,
that Monsieur Ravignan being returned from the French
Court with an account, that the King of France refused to
ratify the capitulation for the surrender of the citadel of
Tournay, the approaches have been carried on with great
vigour and success: our miners have discovered several of
the enemy's mines, who have sprung divers others, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
did little execution; but for the better security of the
troops, both assaults are carried on by the cautious way of
sapping. On the 18th, the confederate army made a
general forage without any loss. Marshal Villars continues
in his former camp, and applies himself with great
diligence in casting up new lines behind the old on the
Scarp. The Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene
designed to begin a general review of the army on
the 20th.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Roger Grant was sworn oculist and operator in ordinary to Queen
Anne, September 27, 1710; and on the death of Sir William Read, he
was sworn oculist in ordinary to George I. in 1715 (<i>Weekly Packet</i>,
No. 159). He died in 1724. A pamphlet, published in 1709, price
2d., called, "A full and true Account of a Miraculous Cure of a Young
Man in Newington, that was born Blind, and was in Five Minutes
brought to perfect Sight. By Mr. Roger Grant, Oculist," was in reality
intended to expose Grant as an impostor. William Jones, son of
Annabella Jones, of Newington, Surrey, was, in the twentieth year of
his age, couched by Grant, on June 19, 1709. On Sunday, July 24,
he went, we are told, to the parish church of St. Mary, Newington,
and requested the minister to offer up thanks for his recovery; and
next day he and his mother went to the minister to ask him to certify
a statement to the effect that Jones was born blind and now had his
sight very well. The minister objected to doing this, although Jones
and his mother urged that Grant would charge for the cure if they did
not get the certificate. The pamphlet states that at last they got the
minister's signature forged, and then Grant published the certificate in
the <i>Daily Courant</i> for July 30, 1709. On August 16 another paper
came out, stating that the minister was present at the operation. The
minister told all who made inquiries the truth; that the boy was not
born blind, but only with an imperfection in his sight; and that now he
saw very little with the left eye, and not at all with the right. On
August 8, Grant got the mother to make an affidavit respecting her son's
blindness and cure before a magistrate. This affidavit is printed in the
"British Apollo," vol. ii. No. 91 (January 20 to 23, 1710). The following
advertisement is taken from the same periodical, vol. ii.
No. 39 (August 5 to 10, 1709): "As it would be no less disrespectful
and injurious to the public, to conceal the merits of Mr. Grant, oculist;
therefore, we, the Minister, Churchwardens, and Overseers of the poor
of the parish of St. Mary, Newington Butts, do certify, that William
Jones, of the same parish, aged twenty years, who was born blind, on
his application to Mr. Grant aforesaid, who dwells in St. Christopher's
Court, behind the Royal Exchange, was by him couched on Wednesday,
June 29, 1709, and by the blessing of God, on the skilful hand of
Mr. Grant, the said Jones, in five minutes' time, was brought to see, and
at this time hath his sight very well. This case being so particularly
remarkable, and gratisly performed, we do, therefore, give this public
testimony under our hands, this 25th of July, 1709.&mdash;Minister,
William Taswell; Churchwardens, James Comber, William Dale;
Overseers, Francis Trosse, William Benskin, Walker Wood, John Ship."
The Jones case is included in a list of Grant's cures, "Account of some
Cures," &amp;c., printed on a folio sheet which is supposed to have been
issued in 1713 (Brit. Mus. 1830, c. (18)). The pamphleteer from
whom I have quoted, adds that Grant was bred up a cobbler, or, as
some say, a tinker; and he was an Anabaptist preacher. Nichols says
that "Grant seems to have been more ingenious and reputable than
most of his brother and sister oculists; but, if we may judge from his
very numerous advertisements, he was not less vain, or less indelicate."
A correspondent of the <i>Spectator</i> (see No. 472) bore testimony to the
benefit he had himself derived from Grant, and said that many blind
persons had been cured.</p></div>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 17.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There is a young foreigner committed to my care, who
puzzles me extremely in the questions he asks
about the persons of figure we meet in public places. He
has but very little of our language, and therefore I am
mightily at a loss to express to him things, for which
they have no word in that tongue to which he was born.
It has been often my answer, upon his asking, who such
a fine gentleman is? that he is what we call a "sharper,"
and he wants my explication. I thought it would be
very unjust to tell him, he is the same the French call
Coquin; the Latins, Nebulo; or the Greeks, &#929;&#8049;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
For as custom is the most powerful of all laws, and that
the order of men we call sharpers are received amongst
us, not only with permission, but favour, I thought i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>t
unjust to use them like persons upon no establishment.
Besides that, it would be an unpardonable dishonour to
our country, to let him leave us with an opinion, that our
nobility and gentry kept company with common thieves
and cheats; I told him, they were a sort of tame hussars
that were allowed in our cities, like the wild ones in our
camp, who had all the privileges belonging to us, but
at the same time were not tied to our discipline or laws.
Aletheus, who is a gentleman of too much virtue for the
age he lives in, would not let this matter be thus palliated,
but told my pupil, that he was to understand, that
distinction, quality, merit, and industry, were laid aside
amongst us by the incursions of these civil hussars, who
had got so much countenance, that the breeding and
fashion of the age turned their way to the ruin of order
and economy in all places where they are admitted. But
Sophronius, who never falls into heat upon any subject,
but applies proper language, temper, and skill, with which
the thing in debate is to be treated, told the youth, that
gentleman had spoken nothing, but what was literally
true; but fell upon it with too much earnestness to give a
true idea of that sort of people he was declaiming against,
or to remedy the evil which he bewailed: for the acceptance
of these men being an ill which hath crept into the
conversation part of our lives, and not into our constitution
itself, it must be corrected where it began, and
consequently is to be amended only by bringing raillery
and derision upon the persons who are guilty, or converse
with them. "For the sharpers," continued he, "at present
are not as formerly, under the acceptation of pickpockets;
but are by custom erected into a real and venerable body
of men, and have subdued us to so very particular a
deference to them, that though they are known to be men
without honour or conscience, no demand is called a debt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of honour so indisputably as theirs. You may lose your
honour to them, but they lay none against you: as the
priesthood in Roman Catholic countries can purchase what
they please for the Church, but they can alienate nothing
from it. It is from this toleration, that sharpers are to be
found among all sorts of assemblies and companies, and
every talent amongst men is made use of by some one or
other of the society for the good of their common cause:
so that an unexperienced young gentleman is as often
ensnared by his understanding as his folly: for who could
be unmoved, to hear the eloquent Dromio explain the
constitution, talk in the key of Cato, with the severity of
one of the ancient sages, and debate the greatest question
of State in a common chocolate or coffee-house; who
could, I say, hear this generous declamator, without being
fired at his noble zeal, and becoming his professed
follower, if he might be admitted. Monoculus'<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> gravity
would be no less inviting to a beginner in conversation,
and the snare of his eloquence would equally catch one
who had never seen an old gentleman so very wise, and
yet so little severe. Many other instances of extraordinary
men among the brotherhood might be produced;
but every man who knows the town, can supply himself
with such examples without their being named." Will.
Vafer, who is skilful at finding out the ridiculous side of
a thing, and placing it in a new and proper light (though
he very seldom talks), thought fit to enter into this subject.
He has lately lost certain loose sums, which half the
income of his estate will bring in within seven years:
besides which, he proposes to marry to set all right. He
was therefore indolent enough to speak of this matter with
great impartiality. "When I look round me," said this
easy gentleman, "and consider in a just balance us bubbles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>,
elder brothers, whose support our dull fathers contrived to
depend upon certain acres; with the rooks, whose
ancestors left them the wide world; I cannot but admire
their fraternity, and contemn my own. Is not Jack
Heyday much to be preferred to the knight he has
bubbled? Jack has his equipage, his wenches, and his
followers: the knight so far from a retinue, that he is
almost one of Jack's. However, he is gay, you see, still;
a florid outside&mdash;his habit speaks the man&mdash;and since he
must unbutton, he would not be reduced outwardly, but is
stripped to his upper coat. But though I have great
temptation to it, I will not at this time give the history of
the losing side, but speak the effects of my thoughts, since
the loss of my money, upon the gaining people. This ill
fortune makes most men contemplative and given to
reading; at least it has happened so to me; and the rise
and fall of the family of sharpers in all ages has been my
contemplation."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I find, all times have had of this people; Homer, in
his excellent heroic poem, calls them Myrmidons, who
were a body who kept among themselves, and had nothing
to lose; therefore never spared either Greek or Trojan,
when they fell in their way, upon a party. But there is a
memorable verse which gives us an account of what broke
that whole body, and made both Greeks and Trojans
masters of the secret of their warfare and plunder. There
is nothing so pedantic as many quotations; therefore I
shall inform you only, that in this battalion there were
two officers called Thersites and Pandarus; they were
both less renowned for their beauty than their wit; but
each had this particular happiness, that they were plunged
over head and ears in the same water, which made Achilles
invulnerable; and had ever after certain gifts which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
rest of the world were never to enjoy. Among others,
they were never to know they were the most dreadful to
the sight of all mortals, never to be diffident of their own
abilities, never to blush, or ever to be wounded but by
each other. Though some historians say, gaming began
among the Lydians to divert hunger, I could cite many
authorities to prove it had its rise at the siege of Troy;
and that Ulysses won the sevenfold shield at hazard.
But be that as it may, the ruin of the corps of the
myrmidons proceeded from a breach between Thersites
and Pandarus. The first of these was leader of a squadron,
wherein the latter was but a private man; but having all
the good qualities necessary for a partisan, he was the
favourite of his officer. But the whole history of the
several changes in the order of sharpers, from those
myrmidons to our modern men of address and plunder,
will require that we consult some ancient manuscripts.
As we make these inquiries, we shall diurnally communicate
them to the public, that the knights of the industry may
be better understood by the good people of England.
These sort of men in some ages, were sycophants and
flatterers only, and were endued with arts of life to
capacitate them for the conversation of the rich and great;
but now the bubble courts the impostor, and pretends at
the utmost to be but his equal. To clear up the reasons
and causes in such revolutions, and the alteration of
conduct between fools and cheats, shall be one of our
labours for the good of this kingdom. How therefore
pimps, footmen, fiddlers, and lackeys, are elevated into
companions in this present age, shall be accounted for
from the influence of the planet Mercury<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> on this island;
the ascendency of which sharper over Sol, who is a patron
of the Muses, and all honest professions, has been noted b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>y
the learned Job Gadbury<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> to be the cause, that cunning
and trick are more esteemed than art and science. It
must be allowed also, to the memory of Mr. Partridge,
late of Cecil Street in the Strand, that in his answer to an
horary question, at what hour of the night to set a foxtrap
in June 1705, he has largely discussed, under the
character of Reynard, the manner of surprising all sharpers
as well as him. But of these great points, after more
mature deliberation.</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, August 19.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was this evening representing a complaint sent me out
of the country from Emilia. She says, her neighbours
there have so little sense of what a refined lady of
the town is, that she, who was a celebrated wit in London,
is in that dull part of the world in so little esteem, that
they call her in their base style a tongue-pad. Old
Truepenny bid me advise her to keep her wit till she
comes to town again, and admonish her, that both wit and
breeding are local; for a fine Court lady is as awkward
among country housewives, as one of them would appear
in a drawing-room. It is therefore the most useful
knowledge one can attain at, to understand among what
sort of men we make the best figure; for if there be a
place where the beauteous and accomplished Emilia is
unacceptable, it is certainly a vain endeavour to attempt
pleasing in all conversations. Here is Will. Ubi, who is
so thirsty after the reputation of a companion, that his
company is for anybody that will accept of it; and for
want of knowing whom to choose for himself, is never
chosen by others. There is a certain chastity of behaviour
which makes a man desirable, and which, if he transgresses,
his wit will have the same fate with Delia's beauty, which
no one regards, because all know it is within their power.
The best course Emilia can take, is, to have less humility;
for if she could have as good an opinion of herself for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
having every quality, as some of her neighbours have of
themselves with one, she would inspire even them with a
sense of her merit, and make that carriage (which is now
the subject of their derision) the sole object of their
imitation. Till she has arrived at this value of herself,
she must be contented with the fate of that uncommon
creature, a woman too humble.</p>
<hr class="chap" />


<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 19.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Since my last, I have received a letter from Tom Trump,
to desire that I would do the fraternity of gamesters
the justice to own, that there are notorious sharpers who
are not of their class. Among others, he presented me
with the picture of Harry Coppersmith in little, who
(he says) is at this day worth half a plum,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> by means
much more indirect than by false dice. I must confess,
there appeared some reason in what he asserted; and he
met me since, and accosted me in the following manner:
"It is wonderful to me, Mr. Bickerstaff, that you can
pretend to be a man of penetration, and fall upon us
knights of the industry as the wickedest of mortals, when
there are so many who live in the constant practice of
baser methods unobserved. You cannot (though you
know the story of myself and the North Briton) but allow
I am an honester man than Will. Coppersmith, for all
his great credit among the Lombards. I get my money
by men's follies, and he gets his by their distresses. The
declining merchant communicates his griefs to him, and he
augments them by extortion. If therefore regard is to be
had to the merit of the persons we injure, who is the more
blamable, he that oppresses an unhappy man, or he that
cheats a foolish one? All mankind are indifferently liable
to adverse strokes of fortune; and he who adds to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>,
when he might relieve them, is certainly a worse subject,
than he who unburdens a man whose prosperity is unwieldy
to him. Besides all which, he that borrows of
Coppersmith, does it out of necessity; he that plays with
me, does it out of choice." I allowed Trump there are
men as bad as himself, which is the height of his pretensions;
and must confess, that Coppersmith is the most
wicked and impudent of all sharpers: a creature that
cheats with credit, and is a robber in the habit of a friend.
The contemplation of this worthy person made me reflect
on the wonderful successes I have observed men of the
meanest capacities meet with in the world, and recollected
an observation I once heard a sage man make, which was,
that he had observed, that in some professions, the lower
the understanding, the greater the capacity. I remember,
he instanced that of a banker, and said, "That the fewer
appetites, passions, and ideas a man had, he was the better
for his business." There is little Sir Tristram,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> without
connection in his speech, or so much as common sense, has
arrived by his own natural parts at one of the greatest
estates amongst us. But honest Sir Tristram knows
himself to be but a repository for cash: he is just such a
utensil as his iron chest, and may rather be said to hold
money, than possess it. There is nothing so pleasant as
to be in the conversation of these wealthy proficients.
I had lately the honour to drink half a pint with Sir
Tristram, Harry Coppersmith, and Giles Twoshoes.
These wags give one another credit in discourse according
to their purses; they jest by the pound, and make answers
as they honour bills. Without vanity, I thought mysel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>f
the prettiest fellow of the company; but I had no manner
of power over one muscle in their faces, though they
sneered at every word spoken by each other. Sir Tristram
called for a pipe of tobacco; and telling us tobacco was
a pot-herb, bid the drawer bring in the other half-pint.
Twoshoes laughed at the knight's wit without moderation.
I took the liberty to say, it was but a pun. "A
pun!" says Coppersmith: "you would be a better man
by &pound;10,000 if you could pun like Sir Tristram." With that,
they all burst out together. The queer curs maintained
this style of dialogue till we had drunk our quarts apiece
by half-pints. All I could bring away with me, is, that
Twoshoes is not worth &pound;20,000; for his mirth, though
he was as insipid as either of the others, had no
more effect upon the company, than if he had been a
bankrupt.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, August 19.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have heard, it has been advised by a Diocesan to his
inferior clergy, that instead of broaching opinions of
their own, and uttering doctrines which may lead themselves
and hearers into errors, they would read some of
the most celebrated sermons printed by others for the
instruction of their congregations. In imitation of such
preachers at second-hand, I shall transcribe from Bruy&egrave;re
one of the most elegant pieces of raillery and satire which
I have ever read. He describes the French, as if speaking
of a people not yet discovered, in the air and style of a
traveller.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I have heard talk of a country where the old men are
gallant, polite and civil: the young men, on the contrary,
stubborn, wild, without either manners or civility. They
are free from passion for women, at the age when in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
countries they begin to feel it; and prefer beasts, victuals,
and ridiculous amours, before them. Amongst these
people, he is sober who is never drunk with anything but
wine; the too frequent use of it has rendered it flat and
insipid to them: they endeavour by brandy, and other
strong liquors, to quicken their taste, already extinguished,
and want nothing to complete their debauches, but to
drink aqua fortis. The women of that country hasten
the decay of their beauty, by their artifices to preserve it:
they paint their cheeks, eyebrows, and shoulders, which
they lay open, together with their breasts, arms and ears,
as if they were afraid to hide those places which they
think will please, and never think they show enough of
them. The physiognomies of the people of that country
are not at all neat, but confused and embarrassed with a
bundle of strange hair, which they prefer before their
natural: with this they weave something to cover their
heads, which descends half-way down their bodies, hides
their features, and hinders you from knowing men by
their faces. This nation has besides this, their God and
their king. The grandees go every day at a certain hour
to a temple they call a church: at the upper end of that
temple there stands an altar consecrated to their God,
where the priest celebrates some mysteries which they call
holy, sacred and tremendous. The great men make a vast
circle at the foot of the altar, standing with their backs to
the priest and the holy mysteries, and their faces erected
towards their king, who is seen on his knees upon a
throne, and to whom they seem to direct the desires of
their hearts, and all their devotion. However, in this
custom there is to be remarked a sort of subordination;
for the people appear adoring their prince and their prince
adoring God. The inhabitants of this region call it&mdash;&mdash;It
is from forty-eight degrees of latitude, and more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>

<p>Letters from Hampstead<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> say, there is a coxcomb
arrived there, of a kind which is utterly new. The fellow
has courage, which he takes himself to be obliged to give
proofs of every hour he lives. He is ever fighting with
the men, and contradicting the women. A lady who sent
him to me, superscribed him with this description out of

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 22.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Poor Cynthio<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> (who does me the honour to talk to me
now and then very freely of his most secret thoughts,
and tells me his most private frailties) owned to me, that
though he is in his very prime of life, love had killed all
his desires, and he was now as much to be trusted with a
fine lady, as if he were eighty. "That one passion for
Clarissa has taken up," said he, "my whole soul, and all my
idle flames are extinguished, as you may observe, ordinary
fires are often put out by the sunshine." This was a
declaration not to be made, but upon the highest opinion
of a man's sincerity; yet as much a subject of raillery as
such a speech would be, it is certain, that chastity is a
nobler quality, and as much to be valued in men as in
women. The mighty Scipio, who (as Bluffe<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> says in the
comedy) was a pretty fellow in his time, was of this mind,
and is celebrated for it by an author of good sense. When
he lived, wit, and humour, and raillery, and public success,
were at as high a pitch in Rome, as at present in England;
yet I believe, there was no man in those days thought that
general at all ridiculous in his behaviour in the following
account of him: Scipio, at four and twenty years of age,<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>had obtained a great victory, and a multitude of prisoners
of each sex, and all conditions, fell into his possession:
among others, an agreeable virgin in her early bloom
and beauty. He had too sensible a spirit to see the
most lovely of all objects without being moved with
passion: besides which, there was no obligation of honour
or virtue to restrain his desires towards one who was his
by the fortune of war. But a noble indignation, and a
sudden sorrow, which appeared in her countenance, when
a conqueror cast his eyes upon her, raised his curiosity to
know her story. He was informed, that she was a lady
of the highest condition in that country, and contracted to
Indibilis, a man of merit and quality. The generous
Roman soon placed himself in the condition of that
unhappy man, who was to lose so charming a bride; and
though a youth, a bachelor, a lover, and a conqueror,
immediately resolved to resign all the invitations of his
passion, and the rights of his power, to restore her to her
destined husband. With this purpose he commanded her
parents and relations, as well as her husband, to attend
him at an appointed time. When they met, and were
waiting for the general, my author frames to himself the
different concern of an unhappy father, a despairing lover,
and a tender mother, in the several persons who were so
related to the captive. But for fear of injuring the delicate
circumstances with an old translation, I shall proceed to
tell you, that Scipio appears to them, and leads in his
prisoner into their presence. The Romans (as noble as
they were) seemed to allow themselves a little too much
triumph over the conquered; therefore, as Scipio
approached, they all threw themselves on their knees,
except the lover of the lady: but Scipio observing in him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>a manly sullenness, was the more inclined to favour
him, and spoke to him in these words: "It is not the
manner of the Romans to use all the power they justly
may: we fight not to ravage countries, or break through
the ties of humanity; I am acquainted with your
worth, and your interest in this lady: fortune has made
me your master; but I desire to be your friend.
This is your wife; take her, and may the gods bless you
with her. But far be it from Scipio to purchase a loose
and momentary pleasure at the rate of making an honest
man unhappy." Indibilis' heart was too full to make him
any answer, but he threw himself at the feet of the general
and wept aloud. The captive lady fell into the same posture,
and they both remained so till the father burst into
the following words: "O divine Scipio! The gods
have given you more than human virtue. O glorious
leader! O wondrous youth! Does not that obliged
virgin give you, while she prays to the gods for your
prosperity, and thinks you sent down from them, raptures,
above all the transports which you could have reaped from
the possession of her injured person?" The temperate
Scipio answered him without much emotion, and, saying,
"Father, be a friend to Rome," retired. An immense
sum was offered as her ransom; but he sent it to her
husband, and smiling, said, "This is a trifle after what I
have given him already; but let Indibilis know, that
chastity at my age is a much more difficult virtue to practise
than generosity." I observed, Cynthio was very much
taken with my narrative; but told me, this was a virtue
that would bear but a very inconsiderable figure in our
days. However I took the liberty to say, that we ought
not to lose our ideas of things, though we had debauched
our true relish in our practice. For after we have done
laughing, solid virtue will keep its place in men's opinions:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and though custom made it not so scandalous as it ought
to be, to ensnare innocent women, and triumph in the
falsehood; such actions as we have here related, must be
accounted true gallantry, and rise the higher in our esteem,
the farther they are removed from our imitation.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, August 22.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">A man would be apt to think in this laughing town,
that it were impossible a thing so exploded as speaking
hard words should be practised by any one that had
ever seen good company; but as if there were a standard
in our minds as well as bodies, you see very many just
where they were twenty years ago, and more they cannot,
will not arrive at. Were it not thus, the noble Martius
would not be the only man in England whom nobody can
understand, though he talks more than any man else,
Will. Dactyle the epigrammatist, Jack Comma the
grammarian, Nick Cross-grain who writes anagrams,
and myself, made a pretty company at a corner of this
room, and entered very peaceably upon a subject fit enough
for us; which was, the examination of the force of the
particle "for," when Martius joined us. He being well
known to us all, asked what we were upon? For he had
a mind to consummate the happiness of the day, which
had been spent among the stars of the first magnitude,
among the men of letters; and therefore, to put a period
to it, as he had commenced it, he should be glad to be
allowed to participate of the pleasure of our society. I
told him the subject. "Faith, gentlemen," said Martius,
"your subject is humble; and if you would give me
leave to elevate the conversation, I should humbly offer,
that you would enlarge your inquiries to the word 'forasmuch':
for though I take it," said he, "to be but one
word; yet, the particle 'much' implying quantity, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
particle 'as' similitude, it will be greater, and more like
ourselves, to treat of 'forasmuch.'" Jack Comma is
always serious, and answered, "Martius, I must take
the liberty to say, that you have fallen into all this
error and profuse manner of speech by a certain hurry in
your imagination, for want of being more exact in the
knowledge of the parts of speech; and it is so with all
men who have not well studied the particle 'for.' You
have spoken 'for' without making any inference, which is
the great use of that particle. There is no manner of
force in your observation of quantity and similitude in
the syllables 'as' and 'much.' But it is ever the fault of
men of great wit to be incorrect; which evil they run
into by an indiscreet use of the word 'for.' Consider all
the books of controversy which have been written, and I'll
engage you will observe, that all the debate lies in this
point, whether they brought in 'for' in a just manner, or
forced it in for their own use, rather than as understanding
the use of the word itself? There is nothing like
familiar instances: you have heard the story of the Irishman,
who reading, 'Money for Live Hair,' took a lodging
and expected to be paid for living at that house. If this
man had known 'for' was in that place, of a quite different
signification from the particle 'to,' he could not have fallen
into the mistake of taking 'live' for what the Latins call
<i>vivere</i>, or rather <i>habitare</i>" Martius seemed at a loss;
and admiring his profound learning, wished he had been
bred a scholar, for he did not take the scope of his discourse.
This wise debate, of which we had much more,
made me reflect upon the difference of their capacities,
and wonder that there could be as it were a diversity in
men's genius for nonsense; that one should bluster,
while another crept in absurdities. Martius moves like a
blind man, lifting his legs higher than the ordinary way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
of stepping; and Comma, like one who is only short-sighted,
picking his way when he should be marching on.
Want of learning makes Martius a brisk entertaining
fool, and gives himself a full scope; but that which
Comma has, and calls learning, makes him diffident, and
curb his natural misunderstanding, to the great loss of the
men of raillery. This conversation confirmed me in the
opinion, that learning usually does but improve in us
what nature endowed us with. He that wants good sense,
is unhappy in having it, for he has thereby only more ways
of exposing himself; and he that has sense, knows that
learning is not knowledge, but rather the art of using it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">We<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> have undoubted intelligence of the defeat of the
King of Sweden; and that prince (who for some
years had hovered like an approaching tempest, and was
looked up at by all the nations of Europe, which seemed
to expect their fate according to the course he should take),
is now, in all probability, an unhappy exile, without the
common necessaries of life. His Czarish Majesty treats
his prisoners with great gallantry and distinction. Count
Rheinsfeldt has had particular marks of his Majesty's
esteem, for his merit and services to his master; but
Count Piper, whom his Majesty believes author of the
most violent councils into which his prince entered, is disarmed
and entertained accordingly. That decisive battle
was ended at nine in the morning, and all the Swedish
generals dined with the Czar that very day, and received
assurances that they should find Muscovy was not unacquainted
with the laws of honour and humanity.</p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 24.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">&AElig;sop has gained to himself an immortal renown for
figuring the manners, desires, passions, and interests
of men, by fables of beasts and birds: I shall in my future
accounts of our modern heroes and wits, vulgarly called
"sharpers," imitate the method of that delightful moralist;
and think, I cannot represent those worthies more naturally
than under the shadow of a pack of dogs; for this set of
men are like them, made up of finders, lurchers, and
setters. Some search for the prey, others pursue others
take it; and if it be worth it, they all come in at the
death, and worry the carcass. It would require a most
exact knowledge of the field, and the harbours where the
deer lie, to recount all the revolutions in the chase: but I
am diverted from the train of my discourse of the fraternity
about this town by letters from Hampstead, which give
me an account, there is a late institution there, under the
name of a raffling-shop, which is, it seems, secretly supported
by a person who is a deep practitioner in the law,
and, out of tenderness of conscience, has, under the name
of his maid Sisly, set up this easier way of conveyancing
and alienating estates from one family to another. He is
so far from having an intelligence with the rest of the
fraternity, that all the humbler cheats who appear there,
are faced by the partners in the bank, and driven off by the
reflection of superior brass. This notice is given to all the
silly faces that pass that way, that they may not be decoyed
in by the soft allurement of a fine lady, who is the sign to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the pageantry. And at the same time Signior Hawksly,
who is the patron of the household, is desired to leave off
this interloping trade, or admit, as he ought to do, the
knights of the industry to their share in the spoil. But
this little matter is only by way of digression. Therefore
to return to our worthies: the present race of terriers and
hounds would starve, were it not for the enchanted Act&aelig;on,
who has kept the whole pack for many successions of
hunting seasons. Act&aelig;on has long tracts of rich soil;
but had the misfortune in his youth to fall under the
power of sorcery, and has been ever since, some parts of
the year, a deer, and in some parts a man. While he is a
man (such is the force of magic), he no sooner grows to
such a bulk and fatness, but he is again turned into a deer,
and hunted till he is lean; upon which he returns to his
human shape. Many arts have been tried, and many
resolutions taken by Act&aelig;on himself, to follow such
methods as would break the enchantment; but all have
hitherto proved ineffectual. I have therefore, by midnight
watchings and much care, found out, that there is no
way to save him from the jaws of his hounds, but to
destroy the pack, which, by astrological prescience, I
find I am destined to perform. For which end I have
sent out my familiar, to bring me a list of all the
places where they are harboured, that I may know where
to sound my horn, and bring them together, and take an
account of their haunts and their marks, against another
opportunity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The author of the ensuing letter, by his name, and the
quotations he makes from the ancients, seems a sort
of spy from the old world, whom we moderns ought to be
careful of offending; therefore I must be free, and own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Having a peculiar humour of desiring to be somewhat
the better or wiser for what I read, I am always
uneasy when, in any profound writer (for I read no others),
I happen to meet with what I cannot understand. When
this falls out, it is a great grievance to me that I am not
able to consult the author himself about his meaning; for
commentators are a sect that has little share in my esteem.
Your elaborate writings have, among many others, this
advantage, that their author is still alive, and ready (as his
extensive charity makes us expect) to explain whatever
may be found in them too sublime for vulgar understandings.
This, sir, makes me presume to ask you, how the
Hampstead hero's<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> character could be perfectly new when
the last letters came away, and yet Sir John Suckling so
well acquainted with it sixty years ago? I hope, sir, you
will not take this amiss: I can assure you, I have a profound
respect for you; which makes me write this, with
the same disposition with which Longinus bids us read
Homer and Plato. 'When in reading,' says he, 'any of
those celebrated authors, we meet with a passage to which
we cannot well reconcile our reasons, we ought firmly to
believe, that were those great wits present to answer for
themselves, we should to our wonder be convinced, that
we only are guilty of the mistakes we before attributed to
them.' If you think fit to remove the scruple that now
torments me, it will be an encouragement to me to settle <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>a
frequent correspondence with you, several things falling in
my way which would not, perhaps, be altogether foreign
to your purpose, and whereon your thoughts would be
very acceptable to</p>

<p class="center">"Your most humble Servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Obadiah Greenhat.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I own this is clean, and Mr. Greenhat has convinced me
that I have writ nonsense; yet am I not at all offended at
him.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Scimus, et hanc veniam petimusque damusque vicissim.</i><a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the true art of raillery, when a man turns
another into ridicule, and shows at the same time he is in
good humour, and not urged by malice against the person
he rallies. Obadiah Greenhat has hit this very well: for
to make an apology to Isaac Bickerstaff, an unknown
student and horary historian, as well as astrologer, and
with a grave face to say, he speaks of him by the same
rules with which he would treat Homer or Plato, is to
place him in company where he cannot expect to make a
figure; and makes him flatter himself, that it is only being
named with them which renders him most ridiculous. I
have not known, and I am now past my grand climacteric,
being sixty-four years of age, according to my way of life,
or rather (if you will allow punning in an old gentleman)
according to my way of pastime; I say, old as I am, I
have not been acquainted with many of the Greenhats.
There is indeed one Zedekiah Greenhat, who is lucky also
in his way. He has a very agreeable manner; for when
he has a mind thoroughly to correct a man, he never takes
from him anything, but he allows him something for it;
or else, he blames him for things wherein he is not defective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>,
as well as for matters wherein he is. This makes a
weak man believe he is in jest in the whole. The other
day he told Beau Prim, who is thought impotent, that his
mistress had declared she would not have him, because he
was a sloven, and had committed a rape. The beau bit at
the banter, and said very gravely, he thought to be clean
was as much as was necessary; and that as to the rape, he
wondered by what witchcraft that should come to her ears;
but it had indeed cost him a hundred pounds to hush the
affair. The Greenhats are a family with small voices and
short arms, therefore they have power with none but their
friends: they never call after those who run away from
them, or pretend to take hold of you if you resist. But
it has been remarkable, that all who have shunned their
company, or not listened to them, have fallen into the
hands of such as have knocked out their own brains, or
broken their bones. I have looked over our pedigree
upon the receipt of this epistle, and find the Greenhats
are akin to the Staffs. They descend from Maudlin, the
left-handed wife of Nehemiah Bickerstaff, in the reign of
Harry II. And it is remarkable, that they are all left-handed,
and have always been very expert at single rapier.
A man must be very much used to their play to know
how to defend himself; for their posture is so different
from that of the right-handed, that you run upon their
swords if you push forward; and they are in with you, if
you offer to fall back without keeping your guard. There
have been other letters lately sent to me which relate to
other people: among others, some whom I have heretofore
declared to be so, are deceased. I must not therefore
break through rules so far, as to speak ill of the dead.
This maxim extends to all but the late Partridge, who still
denies his death. I am informed indeed by several, that
he walks; but I shall with all convenient speed lay him.</p>

<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, August 24.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">We hear from Tournay, that on the night between
the 22nd and 23rd, they went on with their works
in the enemy's mines, and levelled the earth which was
taken out of them. The next day, at eight in the morning,
when the French observed we were relieving our trenches,
they sprung a larger mine than any they had fired during
this siege, which killed only four private sentinels. The
ensuing night, we had three men and two officers killed,
as also seven men wounded. Between the 24th and 25th,
we repaired some works, which the enemy had ruined.
On the next day, some of the enemy's magazines blew up;
and it is thought they were destroyed on purpose by some
of their men, who are impatient of the hardships of the
present service. There happened nothing remarkable for
two or three days following. A deserter, who came out
of the citadel on the 27th, says, the garrison is brought
to the utmost necessity; that their bread and water are
both very bad; and that they were reduced to eat horse-flesh.
The manner of fighting in this siege has discovered
a gallantry in our men unknown to former ages; their
meeting with adverse parties underground, where every
step is taken with apprehensions of being blown up with
mines below them, or crushed by the fall of the earth
above them, and all this acted in darkness, has something
in it more terrible than ever is met with in any other part
of a soldier's duty. However, this is performed with
great cheerfulness. In other parts of the war we have
also good prospects: Count Thaun has taken Annecy, and
the Count de Merci marched into Franche Comt&eacute;, while his
Electoral Highness is much superior in number to Monsieur
d'Harcourt; so that both on the side of Savoy and Germany,
we have reason to expect very suddenly some great event.</p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 26.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">To proceed regularly in the history of my worthies, I
ought to give you an account of what has passed
from day to day in this place; but a young fellow of my
acquaintance has so lately been rescued out of the hands of
the knights of the industry, that I rather choose to relate
the manner of his escape from them, and the uncommon
way which was used to reclaim him, than to go on in my
intended diary. You are to know then, that Tom Wildair
is a student of the Inner Temple, and has spent his time,
since he left the university for that place, in the common
diversions of men of fashion; that is to say, in whoring,
drinking, and gaming. The two former vices he had
from his father; but was led into the last by the conversation
of a partisan of the Myrmidons, who had chambers
near him. His allowance from his father was a very
plentiful one for a man of sense, but as scanty for a modern
fine gentleman. His frequent losses had reduced him to
so necessitous a condition, that his lodgings were always
haunted by impatient creditors, and all his thoughts
employed in contriving low methods to support himself,
in a way of life from which he knew not how to retreat,
and in which he wanted means to proceed. There is
never wanting some good-natured person to send a man
an account of what he has no mind to hear; therefore
many epistles were conveyed to the father of this extravagant,
to inform him of the company, the pleasures, th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>e
distresses, and entertainments, in which his son passed his
time. The old fellow received these advices with all the
pain of a parent, but frequently consulted his pillow to
know how to behave himself on such important occasions,
as the welfare of his son, and the safety of his fortune.
After many agitations of mind, he reflected, that necessity
was the usual snare which made men fall into meanness, and
that a liberal fortune generally made a liberal and honest
mind; he resolved therefore to save him from his ruin,
by giving him opportunities of tasting what it is to be at
ease, and enclosed to him the following order upon Sir
Tristram Cash:<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>


<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>"Pray pay to Mr. Tho. Wildair, or order, the sum of
one thousand pounds, and place it to the account of,</p>

<p class="center">"Yours,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Humphrey Wildair.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tom was so astonished at the receipt of this order, that
though he knew it to be his father's hand, and that he had
always large sums at Sir Tristram's; yet a thousand pounds
was a trust of which his conduct had always made him
appear so little capable, that he kept his note by him, till
he writ to his father the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Honoured Father</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have received an order under your hand for a thousand
pounds, in words at length, and I think I could swear
it is your hand. I have looked it over and over twenty
thousand times. There is in plain letters, <span class="smcap">T</span>, <span class="smcap">H</span>, <span class="smcap">O</span>, <span class="smcap">U</span>, <span class="smcap">S</span>, <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">N</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span>,:
and after it, the letters <span class="smcap">P</span>, <span class="smcap">O</span>, <span class="smcap">U</span>, <span class="smcap">N</span>, <span class="smcap">D</span>, <span class="smcap">S</span>. I have it still by me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>,
and shall, I believe, continue reading it till I hear from
you."</p></blockquote>

<p>The old gentleman took no manner of notice of the
receipt of his letter; but sent him another order for
three thousand pounds more. His amazement on this
second letter was unspeakable. He immediately double-locked
his door, and sat down carefully to reading and
comparing both his orders. After he had read them till
he was half mad, he walked six or seven turns in his
chamber, then opens his door, then locks it again; and
to examine thoroughly this matter, he locks his door
again, puts his table and chairs against it; then goes into
his closet, and locking himself in, read his notes over
again about nineteen times, which did but increase his
astonishment. Soon after, he began to recollect many
stories he had formerly heard of persons who had been
possessed with imaginations and appearances which had no
foundation in nature, but had been taken with sudden
madness in the midst of a seeming clear and untainted
reason. This made him very gravely conclude he was out
of his wits; and with a design to compose himself, he
immediately betakes him to his nightcap, with a resolution
to sleep himself into his former poverty and senses. To
bed therefore he goes at noonday, but soon rose again,
and resolved to visit Sir Tristram upon this occasion. He
did so, and dined with the knight, expecting he would
mention some advice from his father about paying him
money; but no such thing being said, "Look you, Sir
Tristram," said he, "you are to know, that an affair has
happened, which&mdash;&mdash;" "Look you," says Tristram, "I
know, Mr. Wildair, you are going to desire me to
advance; but the late call of the bank, where I have not
yet made my last payment, has obliged me&mdash;&mdash;" Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
interrupted him, by showing him the bill of a thousand
pounds. When he had looked at it for a convenient
time, and as often surveyed Tom's looks and countenance;
"Look you, Mr. Wildair, a thousand pounds&mdash;&mdash;"
Before he could proceed, he shows him the order for
three thousand more. Sir Tristram examined the orders
at the light, and finding at the writing the name, there
was a certain stroke in one letter, which the father and he
had agreed should be to such directions as he desired
might be more immediately honoured, he forthwith pays
the money. The possession of four thousand pounds
gave my young gentleman a new train of thoughts: he
began to reflect upon his birth, the great expectations he
was born to, and the unsuitable ways he had long pursued.
Instead of that unthinking creature he was before,
he is now provident, generous, and discreet. The father
and son have an exact and regular correspondence, with
mutual and unreserved confidence in each other. The
son looks upon his father as the best tenant he could
have in the country, and the father finds the son the most
safe banker he could have in the City.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, August 26.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There is not anything in nature so extravagant, but
that you will find one man or other that shall practise
or maintain it; otherwise, Harry Spondee could not have
made so long an harangue as he did here this evening concerning
the force and efficacy of well-applied nonsense.
Among ladies, he positively averred, it was the most
prevailing part of eloquence; and had so little complaisance
as to say, a woman is never taken by her reason,
but always by her passion. He proceeded to assert, the
way to move that, was only to astonish her. "I know,"
continued he, "a very late instance of this; for being by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
accident in the next room to Strephon, I could not help
overhearing him as he made love to a certain great lady's
woman. The true method in your application to one of
this second rank of understanding, is not to elevate and
surprise, but rather to elevate and amaze. Strephon is a
perfect master in this kind of persuasion: his way is, to
run over with a soft air a multitude of words, without
meaning or connection, but such as do each of them
apart give a pleasing idea, though they have nothing to
do with each other as he assembles them. After the
common phrases of salutation, and making his entry into
the room, I perceived he had taken the fair nymph's
hand, and kissing it, said, 'Witness to my happiness ye
groves! Be still ye rivulets! Oh! woods, caves, fountains,
trees, dales, mountains, hills, and streams! Oh!
fairest, could you love me?' To which I overheard her
answer, with a very pretty lisp, 'Oh! Strephon, you are
a dangerous creature: why do you talk these tender
things to me? But you men of wit&mdash;&mdash;' 'Is it then
possible,' said the enamoured Strephon, 'that she regards
my sorrows? Oh! Pity, thou balmy cure to an heart
overloaded. If rapture, solicitation, soft desire, and
pleasing anxiety&mdash;&mdash;But still I live in the most afflicting
of all circumstances, doubt&mdash;&mdash;Cannot my charmer
name the place and moment?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>There all those joys insatiably to prove,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With which rich beauty feeds the glutton love.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Forgive me, madam, it is not that my heart is weary
of its chain, but&mdash;&mdash;' This incoherent stuff was answered
by a tender sigh, 'Why do you put your wit to a weak
woman?' Strephon saw he had made some progress in
her heart, and pursued it, by saying that he would certainly
wait upon her at such an hour near Rosamond's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Pond;<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and then&mdash;&mdash;The sylvian deities, and rural
powers of the place, sacred and inviolable to love; love,
the mover of all noble hearts, should hear his vows
repeated by the streams and echoes. The assignation was
accordingly made." This style he calls the unintelligible
method of speaking his mind; and I'll engage, had this
gallant spoken plain English, she had never understood
him half so readily: for we may take it for granted,
that he'll be esteemed as a very cold lover, who discovers
to his mistress that he is in his senses.</p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 29.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Among many phrases which have crept into conversation,
especially of such company as frequent this
place, there is not one which misleads me more, than that
of a fellow of a great deal of fire. This metaphorical
term, "fire," has done much good in keeping coxcombs in
awe of one another; but at the same time it has made them
troublesome to everybody else. You see in the very air
of a fellow of fire, something so expressive of what he
would be at, that if it were not for self-preservation, a
man would laugh out. I had last night the fate to drink
a bottle with two of these firemen, who are indeed dispersed
like the myrmidons<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in all quarters, and to be met with
among those of the most different education. One of my
companions was a scholar with fire; the other a soldier of
the same complexion. My learned man would fall into
disputes, and argue without any manner of provocation or
contradiction: the other was decisive without words, and
would give a shrug or an oath to express his opinion.
My learned man was a mere scholar, and my man of war
as mere a soldier. The particularity of the first was
ridiculous; that of the second, terrible. They were
relations by blood, which in some measure moderated their
extravagances towards each other: I gave myself up
merely as a person of no note in the company, but as if
brought to be convinced, that I was an inconsiderable
thing, any otherwise than that they would show each othe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>r
to me, and make me spectator of the triumph they alternately
enjoyed. The scholar has been very conversant
with books, and the other with men only; which makes
them both superficial: for the taste of books is necessary
to our behaviour in the best company, and the knowledge
of men is required for a true relish of books: but they
have both fire, which makes one pass for a man of sense,
and the other for a fine gentleman. I found I could
easily enough pass my time with the scholar; for if I
seemed not to do justice to his parts and sentiments, he
pitied me, and let me alone. But the warrior could not
let it rest there; I must know all that happened within
his shallow observations of the nature of the war: to all
which he added, an air of laziness, and contempt of those
of his companions who were eminent for delighting in
the exercise and knowledge of their duty. Thus it is,
that all the young fellows of much animal life, and little
understanding, that repair to our armies, usurp upon
the conversation of reasonable men, under the notion of
having fire. The word has not been of greater use to
shallow lovers, to supply them with chat to their mistresses,
than it has been to pretended men of pleasure to support
them in being pert and dull, and saying of every fool of
their order, "Such a one has fire." There is a Colonel
Truncheon, who marches with divisions ready on all
occasions; a hero who never doubted in his life, but is
ever positively fixed in the wrong, not out of obstinate
opinion, but invincible stupidity. It is very unhappy for
this latitude of London, that it is possible for such as can
learn only fashion, habit, and a set of common phrases of
salutation, to pass with no other accomplishments in this
nation of freedom for men of conversation and sense. All
these ought to pretend to, is, not to offend; but they carry
it so far, as to be negligent, whether they offend or not;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
for they have fire. But their force differs from true spirit,
as much as a vicious from a mettlesome horse. A man of
fire is a general enemy to all the waiters where you drink,
is the only man affronted at the company's being neglected,
and makes the drawers abroad, his <i>valet-de-chambre</i> and
footman at home, know, he is not to be provoked without
danger. This is not the fire that animates the noble
Marinus,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> a youth of good nature, affability, and moderation.
He commands his ship, as an intelligence moves its orb;
he is the vital life, and his officers the limbs of the machine.
His vivacity is seen in doing all the offices of life with
readiness of spirit, and propriety in the manner of doing
them. To be ever active in laudable pursuits, is the
distinguishing character of a man of merit; while the
common behaviour of every gay coxcomb of fire is to be
confidently in the wrong, and dare to persist in it.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, August 29.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is a common objection against writings of a satirical
mixture, that they hurt men in their reputations, and
consequently in their fortunes and possessions; but a
gentleman who frequents this room declared, he was of
opinion it ought to be so, provided such performances
had their proper restrictions. The greatest evils in human
society are such as no law can come at; as in the case of
ingratitude, where the manner of obliging very often
leaves the benefactor without means of demanding justice,
though that very circumstance should be the more binding
to the person who has received the benefit. On such an
occasion, shall it be possible for the malefactor to escape?</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>
<p>And is it not lawful to set marks upon persons who live
within the law, and do base things? Shall not we use the
same protection of those laws to punish them, which they
have to defend themselves? We shall therefore take it
for a very moral action to find a good appellation for
offenders, and to turn them into ridicule under feigned
names. I am advertised by a letter of August the 25th,
that the name of Coppersmith<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> has very much wanted
explanation in the city, and by that means unjustly given,
by those who are conscious they deserve it themselves, to
an honest and worthy citizen<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>&mdash;belonging to the Copper
Office; but that word is framed out of a moral consideration
of wealth amongst men, whereby he that has gotten
any part of it by injustice and extortion, is to be thought
in the eye of virtuous men so much the poorer for such
gain. Thus all the gold which is torn from our neighbours,
by making advantage of their wants, is copper;
and I authorise the Lombards to distinguish themselves
accordingly. All the honest, who make a reasonable
profit, both for the advantage of themselves and those
they deal with, are goldsmiths; but those who tear
unjustly all they can, coppersmiths. At the same time I
desire him who is most guilty, to sit down satisfied with
riches and contempt, and be known by the title of the
Coppersmith; as being the chief of that respected, contemptible
fraternity.</p>

<p>This is the case of all others mentioned in our lucubrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>,
particularly of Stentor,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> who goes on in his vociferations
at St. Paul's with so much obstinacy, that he has
received admonition from St. Peter's for it from a person
of eminent wit and piety;<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> but who is by old age reduced
to the infirmity of sleeping at a service, to which he had
been fifty years attentive, and whose death, whenever it
happens, may, with that of the saints, well be called,
falling asleep; for the innocence of his life makes him
expect it as indifferently as he does his ordinary rest.
This gives him a cheerfulness of spirit to rally his own
weakness, and hath made him write to Stentor to hearken
to my admonitions. "Brother Stentor," said he, "for
the repose of the church, hearken to Bickerstaff, and
consider, that while you are so devout at St. Paul's, we
cannot sleep for you at St. Peter's."</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, August 29.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There has been lately sent me a much harder question
than was ever yet put to me since I professed astrology;
to wit, how far, and to what age, women ought to
make their beauty their chief concern? The regard and
care of their faces and persons are as variously to be considered,
as their complexions themselves differ; but if
one may transgress against the careful practice of the fair
sex so much as to give an opinion against it, I humbly
presume, that less care, better applied, would increase
their empire, and make it last as long as life. Wherea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>s
now, from their own example, we take our esteem of their
merit; for it is very just, that she who values herself only
on her beauty, should be regarded by others on no other
consideration. There is certainly a liberal and pedantic
education among women as well as men, and the merit
lasts accordingly. She therefore that is bred with freedom,
and in good company, considers men according to their
respective characters and distinctions; while she that is
locked up from such observations, will consider her
father's butler not as a butler, but as a man. In like
manner, when men converse with women, the well-bred
and intelligent are looked upon with an observation suitable
to their different talents and accomplishments, without
respect to their sex; while a mere woman can be observed
under no consideration but that of a woman; and there
can be but one reason for placing any value upon her, or
losing time in her company. Wherefore I am of opinion,
that the rule for pleasing long, is, to obtain such qualifications
as would make them so were they not women.
Let the beauteous Cleomira then show us her real face,
and know, that every stage of life has its peculiar charms,
and that there is no necessity for fifty to be fifteen: that
childish colouring of her cheeks is as ungraceful, as that
shape would have been when her face wore its real countenance.
She has sense, and ought to know, that if she
will not follow nature, nature will follow her. Time
then has made that person, which had (when I visited her
grandfather) an agreeable bloom, sprightly air, and soft
utterance, now no less grateful in a lovely aspect, an awful
manner, and maternal wisdom. But her heart was so set
upon her first character, that she neglects and repines at
her present; not that she is against a more staid conduct
in others, for she recommends gravity, circumspection,
and severity of countenance, to her daughter. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
against all chronology, the girl is the sage, the mother the
fine lady. But these great evils proceed from an unaccountable
wild method in the education of the better half
of the world, the women. We have no such thing as a
standard for good breeding. I was the other day at my
Lady Wealthy's, and asked one of her daughters, how she
did? She answered, she never conversed with men.
The same day I visited at Lady Plantwell's, and asked
her daughter the same question. She answers, "What's
that to you, you old thief?" and gives me a slap on the
shoulders. I defy any man in England, except he knows
the family before he enters, to be able to judge whether
he shall be agreeable or not, when he comes into it. You
find either some odd old woman, who is permitted to rule
as long as she lives, in hopes of her death, and to interrupt
all things; or some impertinent young woman, who will
talk sillily upon the strength of looking beautifully. I
will not answer for it, but that it may be, that I (like all
other old fellows) have a fondness for the fashions and
manners which prevailed when I was young and in fashion
myself: but certain it is, that the taste of grace and beauty
is very much lowered! The fine women they show me
nowadays, are at best but pretty girls to me, who have
seen Sacharissa,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> when all the world repeated the poems
she inspired; and Villaria,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> when a youthful king was
her subject. The things you follow and make songs on
now, should be sent to knit, or sit down to bobbing or
bone-lace: they are indeed neat, and so are their sempstresses;
they are pretty, and so are their handmaids. But
that graceful motion, that awful mien, and that winnin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>g
attraction, which grew upon them from the thoughts and
conversations they met with in my time, are now no more
seen. They tell me I am old: I am glad I am so; for I don't
like your present young ladies. Those among us who do
set up for anything of decorum, do so mistake the matter,
that they offend on the other side. Five young ladies who
are of no small fame for their great severity of manners
and exemplary behaviour, would lately go nowhere
with their lovers but to an organ-loft in a church, where
they had a cold treat, and some few opera songs, to
their great refreshment and edification. Whether these
prudent persons had not been as much so if this had been
done at a tavern, is not very hard to determine. It is
such silly starts and incoherences which undervalue the
beauteous sex, and puzzle us in our choice of sweetness of
temper and simplicity of manners, which are the only lasting
charms of woman. But I must leave this important
subject at present, for some matters which press for publication;
as you will observe in the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"It is natural for distant relations to claim kindred with
a rising family; though at this time, zeal to my
country, not interest, calls me out. The City forces<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
being shortly to take the field, all good Protestants would
be pleased that their arms and valour should shine with
equal lustre. A council of war was lately held, the
Honourable Colonel Mortar being president. After many
debates, it was unanimously resolved, that Major Blunder,
a most expert officer, should be detached for Birmingham
to buy arms, and to prove his firelocks on the spot, as
well to prevent expense, as disappointment in the day o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>f
battle. The major being a person of consummate experience,
was invested with a discretionary power. He knew
from ancient story, that securing the rear, and making a
glorious retreat, was the most celebrated piece of conduct.
Accordingly such measures were taken to prevent surprise
in the rear of his arms, that even Pallas herself, in the
shape of rust, could not invade them. They were drawn
into close order, firmly embodied, and arrived securely
without touch-holes. Great and national actions deserve
popular applause; and as praise is no expense to the
public, therefore, dearest kinsman, I communicate this to
you, as well to oblige this nursery of heroes, as to do
justice to my native country. I am</p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, August 31.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">This place being frequented by persons of condition, I
am desired to recommend a dog kennel to any who
shall want a pack. It lies not far from Suffolk Street,<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>d
is kept by two who were formerly dragoons in the French
service; but left plundering for the more orderly life of
keeping dogs: besides that, according to their expectation,
they find it more profitable, as well as more conducing to
the safety of their skin, to follow this trade, than the beat
of drum. Their residence is very convenient for the dogs
to whelp in, and bring up a right breed to follow the
scent. The most eminent of the kennel are bloodhounds,
which lead the van, and are as follow:</p>


<p class="center"><i>A List of the Dogs.</i></p>

<p>Jowler, of a right Irish breed, called Captain.</p>

<p>Rockwood, of French race, with long hair, by the
courtesy of England called also Captain.</p>

<p>Pompey, a tall hound, kennelled in a convent in France,
and knows a rich soil.</p>

<p>The two last hunt in couple, and are followed by,</p>

<p>Ringwood, a French black whelp of the same breed, a
fine open-mouthed dog; and an old sick hound, always in
kennel; but of the true blood, with a good nose, French
breed.</p>

<p>There is also an Italian greyhound, with good legs, and
knows perfectly the ground from Ghent to Paris.</p>

<p>Ten setting dogs, right English.</p>

<p>Four mongrels, of the same nation.</p>

<p>And twenty whelps, fit for any game.</p>

<p>These curs are so extremely hungry, that they are too
keen at the sport, and worry their game before the keepers
can come in. The other day a wild boar from the north
rushed into the kennel, and at first indeed defended him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>self
against the whole pack; but they proved at last too
many for him, and tore twenty-five pounds of flesh from
off his back, with which they filled their bellies, and made so
great a noise in the neighbourhood, that the keepers are
obliged to hasten the sale. That quarter of the town
where they are kennelled is generally inhabited by
strangers, whose blood the hounds have often sucked in
such a manner, that many a German count, and other
<i>virtuosi</i>, who come from the Continent, have lost the
intention of their travels, and been unable to proceed on
their journey.</p>

<p>If these hounds are not very soon disposed of to
some good purchaser, as also those at the kennels nearer
St. James's, it is humbly proposed, that they may be altogether
transported to America, where the dogs are few, and
the wild beasts many. Or, that during their stay in these
parts, some eminent justice of the peace may have it in
particular direction to visit their harbours; and that the
Sheriff of Middlesex may allow him the assistance of the
common hangman to cut off their ears, or part of them,
for distinction-sake, that we may know the bloodhounds
from the mongrels and setters. Till these things are
regulated, you may inquire at a house belonging to Paris
at the upper end of Suffolk Street, or a house belonging
to Ghent, opposite to the lower end of Pall Mall, and
know further.</p>

<p>It were to be wished that these curs were disposed of;
for it is a very great nuisance to have them tolerated in
cities. That of London takes care, that the common
hunt, assisted by the Sergeants and bailiffs, expel them
wherever they are found within the walls; though it is
said, some private families keep them, to the destruction
of their neighbours: but it is desired, that all who know
of any of these curs, or have been bit by them, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
send me their marks, and the houses where they are
harboured, and I do not doubt but I shall alarm the
people so well, as to have them used like mad dogs
wherever they appear. In the meantime, I advise all such
as entertain this kind of vermin, that if they give me
timely notice that their dogs are dismissed, I shall let
them go unregarded, otherwise am obliged to admonish
my fellow subjects in this behalf, and instruct them how
to avoid being worried, when they are going about their
lawful professions and callings. There was lately a young
gentleman bit to the bone; who has now indeed recovered
his health, but is as lean as a skeleton. It grieved my
heart to see a gentleman's son run among the hounds;
but he is, they tell me, as fleet and as dangerous as the
best of the pack.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, August 31.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">This evening was spent at our table in discourse of
propriety of words and thoughts, which is Mr.
Dryden's definition of wit;<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but a very odd fellow, who
would intrude upon us, and has a briskness of imagination
more like madness than regular thought, said,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> that Harry
Jacks was the first who told him of the taking of the
citadel of Tournay,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> "and," says he, "Harry deserves a
statue more than the boy who ran to the Senate with a
thorn in his foot to tell of a victory." We were astonished
at the assertion, and Spondee asked him, "What
affinity is there between that boy and Harry, that you sa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>y
their merit resembles so much as you just now told us?"
"Why," says he, "Harry you know is in the French
interest, and it was more pain to him to tell the story of
Tournay, than to the boy to run upon a thorn to relate a
victory which he was glad of." The gentleman who was
in the chair upon the subject of propriety of words and
thoughts, would by no means allow, that there was wit
in this comparison; and urged, that to have anything
gracefully said, it must be natural; and that whatsoever
was introduced in common discourse with so much premeditation,
was insufferable. That critic went on: "Had
Mr. Jacks," said he, "told him the citadel was taken,
and another had answered, 'He deserves a statue as well
as the Roman boy, for he told it with as much pain'; it
might have passed for a sprightly expression: but there is
a wit for discourse, and a wit for writing. The easiness
and familiarity of the first, is not to savour in the least
of study; but the exactness of the other, is to admit of
something like the freedom of discourse, especially in discourses
of humanity, and what regards the Belles Lettres.
I do not in this allow, that Bickerstaff's <i>Tatlers</i>, or discourses
of wit by retail, and for the penny, should come
within the description of writing." I bowed at his compliment,
and&mdash;but he would not let me proceed.</p>

<p>You see in no place of conversation the perfection of
speech so much as in an accomplished woman. Whether
it be, that there is a partiality irresistible when we judge of
that sex, or whatever it is, you may observe a wonderful
freedom in their utterance, and an easy flow of words,
without being distracted (as we often are who read much)
in the choice of dictions and phrases. My Lady Courtly
is an instance of this: she was talking the other day of
dress, and did it with so excellent an air and gesture, that
you would have sworn she had learned her action from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
our Demosthenes. Besides which, her words were particularly
well adapted to the matter she talked of, that the
dress was a new thing to us men. She avoided the terms
of art in it, and described an unaffected garb and manner
in so proper terms, that she came up to that of Horace's
"<i>simplex munditiis</i>";<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> which, whoever can translate in two
words, has as much eloquence as Lady Courtly. I took
the liberty to tell her, that all she had said with so much
good grace, was spoken in two words in Horace, but
would not undertake to translate them; upon which
she smiled, and told me, she believed me a very great
scholar, and I took my leave.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, August 31.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have been just now reading the introduction to the
History of Catiline by Sallust, an author who is very
much in my favour; but when I reflect upon his professing
himself wholly disinterested, and at the same time see
how industriously he has avoided saying anything to the
praise of Cicero, to whose vigilance the commonwealth
owed its safety, it very much lessens my esteem for that
writer; and is one argument, among others, for laughing
at all who pretend to be out of the interests of the world,
and profess purely to act for the service of mankind, without
the least regard to themselves. I do not deny but
that the rewards are different; some aim at riches, others
at honour, by their public services. However, they are
all pursuing some end to themselves, though indeed those
ends differ as much as right and wrong. The most
graceful way then, I should think, would be to acknowledge,
that you aim at serving yourselves; but at th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>e
same time make it appear, it is for the service of others
that you have these opportunities. Of all the disinterested
professors I have ever heard of, I take the boatswain of
Dampier's ship to be the most impudent, but the most
excusable.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> You are to know, that in the wild searches
that navigator was making, they happened to be out at
sea, far distant from any shore, in want of all the necessaries
of life; insomuch, that they began to look, not
without hunger, on each other. The boatswain was a
fat, healthy, fresh fellow, and attracted the eyes of the
whole crew. In such an extreme necessity, all forms of
superiority were laid aside: the captain and lieutenant
were safe only by being carrion, and the unhappy boatswain
in danger only by being worth eating. To be
short, the company were unanimous, and the boatswain
must be cut up. He saw their intention, and desired he
might speak a few words before they proceeded; which
being permitted, he delivered himself as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen Sailors</span>,</p>

<p>"Far be it that I should speak it for any private
interest of my own, but I take it, that I should not die
with a good conscience, if I did not confess to you that I
am not sound. I say, gentlemen, justice, and the testimony
of a good conscience, as well as love of my country,
to which I hope you will all return, oblige me to own,
that Black Kate at Deptford has made me very unsafe t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>o
eat; and (I speak it with shame) I am afraid, gentlemen,
I should poison you."</p></blockquote>

<p>This speech had a good effect in the boatswain's favour;
but the surgeon of the ship protested, he had cured him
very well, and offered to eat the first steak of him himself.</p>

<p>The boatswain replied (like an orator, with a true
notion of the people, and in hopes to gain time) that he
was heartily glad if he could be for their service, and
thanked the surgeon for his information. "However,"
said he, "I must inform you, for your own good, that I
have ever since my cure been very thirsty and dropsical;
therefore I presume it would be much better to tap me,
and drink me off, than eat me at once, and have no man
in the ship fit to be drank." As he was going on with his
harangue, a fresh gale arose, and gave the crew hopes of a
better repast at the nearest shore, to which they arrived
next morning.</p>

<p>Most of the self-denials we meet with are of this sort;
therefore I think he acts fairest who owns, he hopes at
least to have brother's fare, without professing that he
gives himself up with pleasure to be devoured for the
preservation of his fellows.</p>


<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, August 31.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Letters from the Hague of the 6th of September, N.S.,
say, that the governor of the citadel at Tournay
having offered their highnesses the Duke of Marlborough
and the Prince of Savoy to surrender that place on the
31st of the last month, on terms which were not allowed
them by those princes, hostilities were thereupon renewed;
but that on the 3rd the place was surrendered, with a
seeming condition granted to the besieged above that of
being prisoners of war; for they were forthwith to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
conducted to Cond&eacute;, but were to be exchanged for
prisoners of the Allies, and particularly those of Warneton
were mentioned in the demand. Both armies having
stretched towards Mons with the utmost diligence, that of
the Allies, though they passed the much more difficult
road, arrived first before that town, which they have now
actually invested; and the quartermaster-general was, at
the time of despatching these letters, marking the ground
for the encampment of the covering army.</p>

<h4><i>Of the Enjoyment of Life with Regard to others.</i><a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></h4>

<p class="drop-cap">I have ever thought it the greatest diminution to the
Roman glory imaginable, that in their institution of
public triumphs, they led their enemies in chains when
they were prisoners. It is to be allowed, that doing all
honour to the superiority of heroes above the rest of
mankind, must needs conduce to the glory and advantage
of a nation; but what shocks the imagination to reflect
upon, is, that a polite people should think it reasonable,
that an unhappy man, who was no way inferior to the
victor, but by the chance of war, should be led like a slave
at the wheels of his chariot. Indeed these other circumstances
of a triumph, that it was not allowed in a civil war,
lest part of it should be in tears, while the other was
making acclamations; that it should not be allowed,
except such a number were slain in battle; that the
general should be disgraced who made a false muster of his
dead: these, I say, had great and politic ends in their
being established, and tended to the apparent benefit of
the commonwealth. But this behaviour to the conquered
had no foundation in nature or policy, only to gratify
the insolence of a haughty people, who triumphed over
barbarous nations, by acting what was fit only for those
very barbarians to practise. It seems wonderful, that they
who were so refined as to take care, that to complete th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>e
honour done to the victorious officer, no power should be
known above him in the Empire on the day of his triumph,
but that the consuls themselves should be but guests at his
table that evening, could not take it into thought to make
the man of chief note among his prisoners one of the
company. This would have improved the gladness of the
occasion, and the victor had made a much greater figure,
in that no other man appeared unhappy on his day, than
in that no other man appeared great. But we will waive
at present such important incidents, and turn our thoughts
rather to the familiar part of human life, and we shall find,
that the great business we contend for, is in a less degree
what those Romans did on more solemn occasions, to
triumph over our fellow creatures; and there is hardly a
man to be found, who would not rather be in pain to
appear happy, than be really happy and thought miserable.
This men attempt by sumptuous equipages, splendid
houses, numerous servants, and all the cares and pursuits
of an ambitious or fashionable life. Bromeo and Tabio
are particularly ill-wishers to each other, and rivals in
happiness. There is no way in nature so good to procure
the esteem of the one, as to give him little notices of
certain secret points wherein the other is uneasy. Gnatho
has the skill of doing this, and never applauds the improvements
Bromeo has been many years making, and ever will
be making; but he adds, "Now this very thing was my
thought when Tabio was pulling up his underwood, yet
he never would hear of it; but now your gardens are in
this posture, he is ready to hang himself. Well, to be
sincere, that situation of his can never make an agreeable
seat: he may make his house and appurtenances what he
pleases; but he cannot remove them to the same ground
where Bromeo stands. But of all things under the sun, a
man that is happy at second-hand is the most monstrous."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
"It is a very strange madness," answers Bromeo, "if a man
on these occasions can think of any end but pleasing
himself. As for my part, if things are convenient, I hate
all ostentation: there is no end of the folly of adapting
our affairs to the imagination of others." Upon which, the
next thing he does, is to enlarge whatever he hears his
rival has attempted to imitate him in; but their misfortune
is, that they are in their time of life, in their estates, and
in their understandings equal; so that the emulation may
continue to the last day of their lives. As it stands now,
Tabio has heard Bromeo has lately purchased two hundred
a year in the annuities since he last settled the account of
their happiness, in which he thought himself to have the
balance. This may seem a very fantastical way of thinking
in these men; but there is nothing so common, as a man's
endeavouring rather to go farther than some other person
towards an easy fortune, than to form any certain standard
that would make himself happy.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, September 2.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Mr. Dactile has been this evening very profuse of his
eloquence upon the talent of turning things into
ridicule; and seemed to say very justly, that there was
generally in it something too disingenuous for the society
of liberal men, except it were governed by the circumstances
of persons, time, and place. "This talent," continued
he, "is to be used as a man does his sword, not to be drawn
but in his own defence, or to bring pretenders and
impostors in society to a true light." But we have seen
this faculty so mistaken, that the burlesque of Virgil himself
has passed, among men of little taste, for wit; and the
noblest thoughts that can enter into the heart of man,
levelled with ribaldry and baseness: though by the rules
of justice, no man ought to be ridiculed for any imper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>fection,
who does not set up for eminent sufficiency in that
way wherein he is defective. Thus cowards, who would
hide themselves by an affected terror in their mien and
dress; and pedants, who would show the depth of their
knowledge by a supercilious gravity, are equally the
objects of laughter. Not that they are in themselves
ridiculous for their want of courage, or weakness of
understanding, but that they seem insensible of their own
place in life, and unhappily rank themselves with those,
whose abilities, compared to their defects, make them
contemptible. At the same time, it must be remarked,
that risibility being the effect of reason, a man ought to
be expelled from sober company who laughs without it.
"Ha! ha!" says Will. Truby, who sat by, "will any man
pretend to give me laws when I should laugh, or tell me
what I should laugh at?" "Look ye," answered
Humphrey Slyboots, "you are mightily mistaken; you
may, if you please, make what noise you will, and nobody
can hinder an English gentleman from putting his face
into what posture he thinks fit; but, take my word for it,
that motion which you now make with your mouth open,
and the agitation of your stomach, which you relieve by
holding your sides, is not laughter: laughter is a more
weighty thing than you imagine; and I'll tell you a secret,
you never did laugh in your life; and truly I am afraid
you never will, except you take great care to be cured of
those convulsive fits." Truby left us, and when he had
got two yards from us, "Well," said he, "you are strange
fellows," and was immediately taken with another fit.</p>

<p>The Trubies are a well-natured family, whose particular
make is such, that they have the same pleasure out of
good Will, which other people have in that scorn which is
the cause of laughter: therefore their bursting into the
figures of men when laughing, proceeds only from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
general benevolence they are born with; as the Slyboots
smile only on the greatest occasion of mirth; which
difference is caused rather from a different structure of
their organs, than that one is less moved than the other.
I know Sowerly frets inwardly when Will. Truby laughs
at him; but when I meet him, and he bursts out, I know
it is out of his abundant joy to see me, which he expresses
by that vociferation which is in others laughter. But I
shall defer considering this subject at large, till I come to
my treatise of oscitation, laughter, and ridicule.</p>

where early instructions have been wanting to imprint
true ideas of things on the tender souls of those of her
sex, they are never after able to arrive at such a pitch of
perfection, as to be above the laws of matter and motion;
laws which are considerably enforced by the principles
usually imbibed in nurseries and boarding-schools. To
remedy this evil, she has laid the scheme of a college for
young damsels; where, instead of scissors, needles, and
sampler; pens, compasses, quadrants, books, manuscripts,
Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, are to take up their whole
time. Only on holidays the students will, for moderate
exercise, be allowed to divert themselves with the use of
some of the lightest and most voluble weapons; and proper
care will be taken to give them at least a superficial tincture
of the ancient and modern Amazonian tactics. Of

Marshal Boufflers arrived in the enemy's camp on the 5th,
and acquainted Marshal Villars, that he did not come in
any character, but to receive his commands for the king's
service, and communicate to him his orders upon the
present posture of affairs. On the 9th, both armies
advanced towards each other, and cannonaded all the
ensuing day till the close of the evening, and stood on
their arms all that night. On the day of battle, the
cannonading was renewed about seven: the Duke of
Argyle had orders to attack the wood Saar on the right,
which he executed so successfully, that he pierced through it,
and won a considerable post. The Prince of Orange had
the same good fortune in a wood on the left: after which,
the whole body of the confederates, joined by the forces
from the siege, marched up, and engaged the enemy, who
were drawn up at some distance from these woods. The
dispute was very warm for some time; but towards noon
the French began to give ground from one wing to the
other: which advantage being observed by our generals,
the whole army was urged on with fresh vigour, and in a
few hours the day ended with the entire defeat of the
enemy.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, September 5.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">When I lately spoke of triumphs, and the behaviour of
the Romans on those occasions,<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> I knew by my
skill in astrology, that there was a great event approaching
to our advantage; but not having yet taken upon me to
tell fortunes, I thought fit to defer the mention of the
battle of Mons<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> till it happened; which moderation was
no final pain to me: but I should wrong my art, if I concealed
that some of my a&euml;rial intelligencers had signified
to me the news of it even from Paris, before the arrival of
Lieutenant-Colonel Graham<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> in England. All nations,
as well as persons, have their good and evil genius attending
them; but the kingdom of France has three, the last of
which is neither for it nor against it in reality, but has for
some months past acted an ambiguous part, and attempted
to save its ward from the incursion of its powerful enemies,
by little subterfuges and tricks, which a nation is more
than undone when it is reduced to practise. Thus, instead
of giving exact accounts and representations of
things, they tell what is indeed true, but at the same time
a falsehood when all the circumstances come to be related.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>Pacolet was at the Court of France on Friday night last,
when this genius of that kingdom came thither in the
shape of a post-boy, and cried out, that Mons was
relieved, and the Duke of Marlborough marched. Pacolet
was much astonished at this account, and immediately
changed his form, and flew to the neighbourhood of Mons,
from whence he found the Allies had really marched, and
began to inquire into the reasons of this sudden change,
and half feared he had heard a truth of the posture of the
French affairs, even in their own country. But upon
diligent inquiry among the a&euml;rials who attend these regions,
and consultation with the neighbouring peasants, he was
able to bring me the following account of the motions of
the armies since they retired from about that place, and
the action which followed thereupon.</p>

<p>On Saturday the 7th of September, N.S., the confederate
army was alarmed in their camp at Havre by
intelligence, that the enemy were marching to attack the
Prince of Hesse. Upon this advice, the Duke of Marlborough
commanded that the troops should immediately
move, which was accordingly performed, and they were all
joined on Sunday the 8th at noon. On that day in the
morning it appeared, that instead of being attacked, the
advanced guard of the detachment commanded by the
Prince of Hesse had dispersed and taken prisoners a party
of the enemy's horse, which was sent out to observe the
march of the confederates. The French moved from
Quiverain on Sunday in the morning, and inclined to the
right from thence all that day. The 9th, the Monday
following, they continued their march till on Tuesday
the 10th they possessed themselves of the woods of Dour
and Blaugies. As soon as they came into that ground,
they threw up entrenchments with all expedition. The
Allies arrived within few hours after the enemy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
posted; but the Duke of Marlborough thought fit to
wait for the arrival of the reinforcement which he expected
from the siege of Tournay. Upon notice that these
troops were so far advanced as to be depended on for an
action the next day, it was accordingly resolved to engage
the enemy.</p>

<p>It will be necessary for understanding the greatness of
the action, and the several motions made in the time of
the engagement, that you have in your mind an idea of
the place. The two armies on the 11th instant were both
drawn up before the woods of Dour, Blaugies, Sart and
Jansart; the army of the Prince of Savoy on the right
before that of Blaugies; the forces of Great Britain in the
centre on his left; those of the High Allies, with the
wood Sart, as well as a large interval of plain ground,
and Jansart, on the left of the whole. The enemy were
entrenched in the paths of the woods, and drawn up
behind two entrenchments over against them, opposite to
the armies of the Duke of Marlborough and Prince
Eugene. There were also two lines entrenched in the
plains over against the army of the States. This was the
posture of the French and confederate forces when the
signal was given, and the whole line moved on to the
charge. The Dutch army, commanded by the Prince of
Hesse, attacked with the most undaunted bravery; and
after a very obstinate resistance, forced the first entrenchment
of the enemy in the plain between Sart and Jansart;
but were repulsed in their attack on the second with
great slaughter on both sides. The Duke of Marlborough,
while this was transacting on the left, had with very much
difficulty marched through Sart, and beaten the enemy
from the several entrenchments they had thrown up in it.
As soon as the Duke had marched into the plain, he
observed the main body of the enemy drawn up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
entrenched in the front of his army. This situation of
the enemy, in the ordinary course of war, is usually
thought an advantage hardly to be surmounted; and
might appear impracticable to any but that army which
had just overcome greater difficulties. The Duke commanded
the troops to form, but to forbear charging till
further order. In the meantime he visited the left
of our line, where the troops of the States had been
engaged. The slaughter on this side had been very great,
and the Dutch incapable of making further progress,
except they were suddenly reinforced. The right of our
line was attacked soon after their coming upon the plain;
but they drove back the enemy with such bravery, that
the victory began to incline to the Allies by the precipitate
retreat of the French to their works, from whence they
were immediately beaten. The Duke upon observing
this advantage on the right, commanded the Earl of
Orkney to march with a sufficient number of battalions to
force the enemy from their entrenchments on the plain
between the woods of Sart and Jansart; which being performed,
the horse of the Allies marched into the plains,
covered by their own foot, and forming themselves in
good order, the cavalry of the enemy attempted no more,
but to cover the foot in their retreat. The Allies made
so good use of the beginning of the victory, that all their
troops moved on with fresh resolution, till they saw the
enemy fly before them towards Cond&eacute; and Maubeuge;
after whom proper detachments were made, who made a
terrible slaughter in the pursuit. In this action it is
said Prince Eugene was wounded, as also the Duke of
Aremberg, and Lieutenant-General Webb. The Count of
Oxenstern, Colonel Lalo, and Sir Thomas Pendergrass,
killed. This wonderful success, obtained under all the
difficulties that could be opposed in the way of an army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
must be acknowledged as owing to the genius, courage
and conduct of the Duke of Marlborough, a consummate
hero; who has lived not only beyond the time in which
C&aelig;sar said, he was arrived at a satiety of life and glory;
but also been so long the subject of panegyric, that it is as
hard to say anything new in his praise, as to add to the
merit which requires such eulogiums.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The following letter<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> being very explanatory of the
true design of our Lucubrations, and at the same
time an excellent model for performing it, it is absolutely
necessary, for the better understanding our works, to
publish it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Though I have not the honour to be of the family of
the Staffs, nor related to any branch of it, yet I
applaud your wholesome project of making wit useful.</p>

<p>"This is what has been, or should have been, intended
by the best comedies. But nobody (I think) before you
thought of a way to bring the stage as it were into the
coffee-house, and there attack those gentlemen who thought
themselves out of the reach of raillery, by prudently
avoiding its chief walks and districts. I smile when I see
a solid citizen of threescore read the article from Will's
Coffee-house, and seem to be just beginning to learn his
alphabet of wit in spectacles; and to hear the attentive
table sometimes stop him with pertinent queries which he
is puzzled to answer, and then join in commending it the
sincerest way, by freely owning he don't understand it.</p>

<p>"In pursuing this design, you will always have a larg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>e
scene before you, and can never be at a loss for characters
to entertain a town so plentifully stocked with them. The
follies of the finest minds, which a philosophic surgeon
knows how to dissect, will best employ your skill: and of
this sort, I take the liberty to send you the following
sketch.</p>

<p>"Cleontes is a man of good family, good learning,
entertaining conversation, and acute wit. He talks well,
is master of style, and writes not contemptibly in verse.
Yet all this serves but to make him politely ridiculous;
and he is above the rank of common characters, only to
have the privilege of being laughed at by the best. His
family makes him proud and scornful; his learning,
assuming and absurd; and his wit, arrogant and satirical.
He mixes some of the best qualities of the head with the
worst of the heart. Everybody is entertained by him,
while nobody esteems him. I am,</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, September 7.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I came hither this evening, and expected nothing else
but mutual congratulations in the company on the
late victory; but found our room, which one would have
hoped to have seen full of good humour and alacrity
upon so glorious an occasion, full of sour animals, inquiring
into the action, in doubt of what had happened, and
fearful of the success of their countrymen. It is natural
to believe easily what we wish heartily; and a certain
rule, that they are not friends to a glad occasion, who
speak all they can against the truth of it; who end their
argument against our happiness, that they wish it otherwise.
When I came into the room, a gentleman was
declaiming; "If," says he, "we have so great and complete
a victory, why have we not the names of the
prisoners? Why is not an exact relation of the conduct
of our generals laid before the world? Why do we not
know where or whom to applaud? If we are victorious,
why do we not give an account of our captives and our
slain? But we are to be satisfied with general notices we
are conquerors, and to believe it so. Sure this is approving
the despotic way of treating the world, which we pretend
to fight against, if we sit down satisfied with such contradictory
accounts, which have the words of triumph, but
do not bear the spirit of it." I whispered Mr. Greenhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Pray what can that dissatisfied man be?" "He is," answered
he, "a character you have not yet perhaps observed.
You have heard of battle-painters, have mentioned a
battle-poet; but this is a battle-critic. He is a fellow
that lives in a government so gentle, that though it sees
him an enemy, suffers his malice because they know his
impotence. He is to examine the weight of an advantage
before the company will allow it." Greenhat was
going on in his explanation, when Sir George England
thought fit to take up the discourse in the following
manner:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, the action you are in so great doubt to
approve of, is greater than ever has been performed in
any age; and the value of it I observe from your dissatisfaction:
for battle-critics are like all others; you
are the more offended, the more you ought to be, and
are convinced you ought to be, pleased. Had this engagement
happened in the time of the old Romans, and
such things been acted in their service, there would not be
a foot of the wood which was pierced but had been consecrated
to some deity, or made memorable by the death
of him who expired in it for the sake of his country.
It had on some monument at the entrance been said,
'Here the Duke of Argyle drew his sword, and said,
March. Here Webb, after having an accomplished fame
for gallantry, exposed himself like a common soldier.
Here Rivet, who was wounded at the beginning of the
day, and carried off as dead, returned to the field, and
received his death.'<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Medals had been struck for ou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>r
general's behaviour when he first came into the plain.
Here was the fury of the action, and here the hero stood
as fearless as if invulnerable. Such certainly had been
the cares of that state for their own honour, and in
gratitude to their heroic subjects. But the wood entrenched,
the plain made more impassable than the
wood, and all the difficulties opposed to the most gallant
army and most intrepid leaders that ever the sun shone
upon, are treated by the talk of some in this room as
objections to the merit of our general and our army;
but," continued he, "I leave all the examination of this
matter, and a proper discourse on our sense of public
actions, to my friend Mr. Bickerstaff, who may let beaus
and gamesters rest, till he has examined into the reasons
of men's being malcontents in the only nation that suffers
professed enemies to breathe in open air."</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 7.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The following letters are sent to me from relations;
and though I do not know who and who are intended,
I publish them. I have only written nonsense
if there is nothing in them; and done a good action if
they alarm any heedless men against the fraternity of the
knights whom the Greeks call &#929;&#8049;&#963;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#962;.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Bickerstaff</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"It is taken very ill by several gentlemen here, that
you are so little vigilant as to let the dogs run from
their kennels to this place. Had you done your duty,
we should have had notice of their arrival; but the
sharpers are now become so formidable here, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>y
have divided themselves into nobles and commons.
Beau Bogg, beau Pert, Rake, and Tallboy are of their
upper house; broken captains, ignorant attorneys, and
such other bankrupts from industrious professions, compose
their lower order. Among these two sets of men,
there happened here lately some unhappy differences:
Squire Humphry came down among us with four
hundred guineas. His raw appearance, and certain
signals in the good-natured muscles of Humphry's
countenance, alarmed the societies. For sharpers are as
skilful as beggars in physiognomy, and know as well
where to hope for plunder, as the others to ask for
alms. Pert was the man exactly fitted for taking with
Humphry as a fine gentleman; for a raw fool is ever
enamoured with his contrary, a coxcomb; and a coxcomb
is what the booby, who wants experience, and is
unused to company, regards as the first of men. He
ever looks at him with envy, and would certainly be
such, if he were not oppressed by his rusticity or
bashfulness. There arose an entire friendship by this
sympathy between Pert and Humphry, which ended in
stripping the latter. We now could see this forlorn
youth for some days moneyless, without sword, and one
day without his hat, and with secret melancholy pining
for his snuff-box; the jest of the whole town, but most
of those who robbed him. At last fresh bills came
down, when immediately their countenances cleared up,
ancient kindnesses and familiarity renewed, and to dinner
he was invited by the fraternity. You are to know, that
while he was in his days of solitude, a commoner who
was excluded from his share of the prey, had whispered
the squire, that he was bit, and cautioned him of venturing
again. However, hopes of recovering his snuff-box,
which was given him by his aunt, made him fall to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
after dinner; yet mindful of what he was told, he saw
something that provoked him to tell them they were a
company of sharpers. Presently Tallboy fell on him,
and being too hard at fisticuffs, drove him out of doors.
The valiant Pert followed, and kicked him in his turn;
which the squire resented, as being nearer his match;
so challenged him: but differing about time and place,
friends interposed (for he had still money left) and
persuaded him to ask pardon for provoking them to
beat him, and they asked his for doing it. The house
consulting whence Humphry could have his information,
concluded it must be from some malicious commoner;
and to be revenged, beau Bogg watched their haunts, and
in a shop where some of them were at play with ladies,
showed dice which he found, or pretended to find upon
them; and declaring how false they were, warned the
company to take care who they played with. By his
seeming candour, he cleared his reputation at least to
fools, and some silly women; but it was still blasted by
the squire's story with thinking men: however, he gained
a great point by it; for the next day he got the company
shut up with himself and fellow-members, and robbed
them at discretion.</p>

<p>"I cannot express to you with what indignation I
behold the noble spirit of gentlemen degenerated to that
of private cut-purses. 'Tis in vain to hope a remedy
while so many of the fraternity get and enjoy estates of
twenty, thirty, and fifty thousand pounds with impunity,
creep into the best conversations, and spread the infectious
villainy through the nation, while the lesser
rogues, that rob for hunger or nakedness, are sacrificed
by the blind, and in this respect partial and defective
law. Could you open men's eyes against the occasion of
all this, the great corrupter of our manners and morality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the author of more bankrupts than the war, and sure
bane of all industry, frugality, and good nature; in a
word, of all virtues; I mean, public or private play at
cards or dice; how willingly would I contribute my
utmost, and possibly send you some memoirs of the
lives and politics of some of the fraternity of great figure,
that might be of use to you in setting this in a clear light
against next session; that all who care for their country
or posterity, and see the pernicious effects of such a
public vice, may endeavour its destruction by some
effectual laws. In concurrence to this good design, I
remain,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The subject of the discourse this evening was Eloquence
and Graceful Action. Lysander, who is
something particular in his way of thinking and speaking,
told us, a man could not be eloquent without
action: for the deportment of the body, the turn of
the eye, and an apt sound to every word that is uttered,
must all conspire to make an accomplished speaker.
Action in one that speaks in public, is the same thing
as a good mien in ordinary life. Thus, as a certain
insensibility in the countenance recommends a sentence
of humour and jest, so it must be a very lively consciousness
that gives grace to great sentiments. The
jest is to be a thing unexpected; therefore your undesigning
manner is a beauty in expressions of mirth; but
when you are to talk on a set subject, the more you are
moved yourself, the more you will move others. "Ther<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>e
is," said he, "a remarkable example of that kind: &AElig;schines,
a famous orator of antiquity, had pleaded at Athens in
a great cause against Demosthenes; but having lost it,
retired to Rhodes. Eloquence was then the quality
most admired among men; and the magistrates of that
place having heard he had a copy of the speech of
Demosthenes, desired him to repeat both their pleadings.
After his own, he recited also the oration of his
antagonist. The people expressed their admiration of
both, but more of that of Demosthenes. 'If you are,'
said he, 'thus touched with hearing only what that great
orator said, how would you have been affected had you
seen him speak? For he who hears Demosthenes only,
loses much the better part of the oration.' Certain it is,
that they who speak gracefully, are very lamely represented
in having their speeches read or repeated by
unskilful people; for there is something native to each
man, so inherent to his thoughts and sentiments, which
it is hardly possible for another to give a true idea of.
You may observe in common talk, when a sentence of any
man's is repeated, an acquaintance of his shall immediately
observe, 'That is so like him, methinks I see how he
looked when he said it.' But of all the people on the
earth, there are none who puzzle me so much as the
clergy of Great Britain, who are, I believe, the most
learned body of men now in the world; and yet this
art of speaking, with the proper ornaments of voice and
gesture, is wholly neglected among them; and I'll engage,
were a deaf man to behold the greater part of them
preach, he would rather think they were reading the
contents only of some discourse they intended to make,
than actually in the body of an oration, even when they
are upon matters of such a nature as one would believe
it were impossible to think of without emotion. I own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
there are exceptions to this general observation, and that
the Dean<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> we heard the other day together, is an orator.
He has so much regard to his congregation, that he
commits to his memory what he is to say to them; and
has so soft and graceful a behaviour, that it must attract
your attention. His person, it is to be confessed, is no
small recommendation; but he is to be highly commended
for not losing that advantage, and adding to the
propriety of speech (which might pass the criticism of
Longinus) an action which would have been approved
by Demosthenes. He has a peculiar force in his way,
and has many of his audience<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> who could not be intelligent
hearers of his discourse, were there not explanation
as well as grace in his action. This art of his is used
with the most exact and honest skill. He never attempts
your passions till he has convinced your reason. All
the objections which he can form are laid open and dispersed,
before he uses the least vehemence in his sermon;
but when he thinks he has your head, he very soon wins
your heart; and never pretends to show the beauty of
holiness till he hath convinced you of the truth of it.
Would every one of our clergymen be thus careful to
recommend truth and virtue in their proper figures, and
show so much concern for them as to give them all the
additional force they were able, it is not possible that
nonsense should have so many hearers as you find it has
in dissenting congregations, for no reason in the world
but because it is spoken extempore; for ordinary minds
are wholly governed by their eyes and ears, and there is
no way to come at their hearts but by power over thei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>r
imaginations. There is my friend and merry companion
Daniel:<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> he knows a great deal better than he speaks,
and can form a proper discourse as well as any orthodox
neighbour. But he knows very well, that to bawl out,
My beloved! and the words, Grace! Regeneration! Sanctification!
A new light! The day! the day! ay, my beloved,
the day! or rather, the night! the night is
coming! and judgment will come, when we least think
of it! and so forth&mdash;he knows to be vehement is the
only way to come at his audience. Daniel, when he sees
my friend Greenhat come in, can give him a good hint,
and cry out, This is only for the saints! the regenerated!
By this force of action, though mixed with all the incoherence
and ribaldry imaginable, Daniel can laugh at
his diocesan, and grow fat by voluntary subscription,
while the parson of the parish goes to law for half his
dues. Daniel will tell you, it is not the shepherd,
but the sheep with the bell, which the flock follows.
Another thing very wonderful this learned body should
omit, is, learning to read; which is a most necessary part
of eloquence in one who is to serve at the altar: for
there is no man but must be sensible, that the lazy tone
and inarticulate sound of our common readers, depreciates
the most proper form of words that were ever extant
in any nation or language, to speak our own wants, or
His power from whom we ask relief. There cannot be
a greater instance of the power of action than in little
Parson Dapper,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> who is the common relief to all the laz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>y
pulpits in town. This smart youth has a very good
memory, a quick eye, and a clean handkerchief. Thus
equipped, he opens his text, shuts his book fairly, shows
he has no notes in his Bible, opens both palms, and shows
all is fair there too. Thus, with a decisive air, my
young man goes on without hesitation; and though, from
the beginning to the end of his pretty discourse, he has
not used one proper gesture, yet at the conclusion the
church-warden pulls his gloves from off his head; 'Pray,
who is this extraordinary young man?' Thus the force
of action is such, that it is more prevalent, even when
improper, than all the reason and argument in the world
without it." This gentleman concluded his discourse by
saying, "I do not doubt but if our preachers would learn
to speak, and our readers to read, within six months'
time we should not have a dissenter within a mile of a
church in Great Britain."</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 9.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have a letter from a young fellow who complains to
me, that he was bred a mercer, and is now just out
of his time, but unfortunately (for he has no manner of
education suitable to his present estate) an uncle has left
him &pound;1000 per annum.</p>

<p>The young man is sensible that he is so spruce, that
he fears he shall never be genteel as long as he lives, but
applies himself to me, to know what method to take to
help his air and be a fine gentleman. He adds, that
several of those ladies who were formerly his customers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>visit his mother on purpose to fall in his way, and fears
he shall be obliged to marry against his will; "for," says
he, "if any one of them should ask me, I shall not be able
to deny her. I am," says he further, "utterly at a loss
how to deal with them; for though I was the most pert
creature in the world when I was foreman, and could
hand a woman of the first quality to her coach, as well
as her own gentleman-usher, I am now quite out of my
way, and speechless in their company. They commend
my modesty to my face. No one scruples to say, I
should certainly make the best husband in the world, a
man of my sober education. Mrs. Would-be watches
all opportunities to be alone with me. Therefore, good
Mr. Bickerstaff, here are my writings enclosed; if you
can find any flaw in my title, so as it may go to the next
heir, who goes to St. James's Coffee-house, and White's,
and could enjoy it, I should be extremely well pleased
with two thousand pounds to set up my trade, and live
in a way I know I should become, rather than be laughed
at all my life among too good company. If you could
send for my cousin, and persuade him to take the estate
on these terms, and let nobody know it, you would
extremely oblige me."</p>

<p>Upon first sight, I thought this a very whimsical
proposal; however, upon more mature consideration, I
could not but admire the young gentleman's prudence
and good sense; for there is nothing so irksome as
living in a way a man knows he does not become. I
consulted Mr. Obadiah Greenhat on this occasion, and
he is so well pleased with the man, that he has half a
mind to take the estate himself; but upon second
thoughts he proposed this expedient. "I should be very
willing," said he, "to keep the estate where it is, if we
could make the young man any way easy; therefore I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
humbly propose he should take to drinking for one half-year,
and make a sloven of him, and from thence begin
his education anew: for it is a maxim, that one who is
ill taught is in a worse condition than he who is wholly
ignorant; therefore a spruce mercer is further off the air
of a fine gentleman than a downright clown. To make
our patient anything better, we must unmake him what
he is." I indeed proposed to flux him; but Greenhat
answered, that if he recovered, he would be as prim and
feat as ever he was: therefore he would have it his way;
and our friend is to drink till he is carbuncled, and tun-bellied;
after which we will send him down to smoke,
and be buried with his ancestors in Derbyshire. I am
indeed desirous he should have his life in the estate,
because he has such a just sense of himself and his abilities,
to know that it is an unhappiness to him to be a man of
fortune. This youth seems to understand, that a gentleman's
life is that of all others the hardest to pass through
with propriety of behaviour; for though he has a support
without art or labour, yet his manner of enjoying
that circumstance is a thing to be considered; and you
see among men who are honoured with the common
appellation of gentlemen, so many contradictions to
that character, that it is the utmost ill-fortune to bear
it: for which reason I am obliged to change the circumstances
of several about this town. Harry Lacker is
so very exact in his dress, that I shall give his estate to
his younger brother, and make him a dancing master.
Nokes Lightfoot is so nimble, and values himself so
much upon it, that I have thoughts of making him
huntsman to a pack of beagles, and give his land to somebody
that will stay upon it.</p>

<p>Now I am upon the topic of becoming what we enjoy,
I forbid all persons who are not of the first quality, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
who do not bear some important office that requires so
much distinction, to go to Hyde Park with six horses, for
I cannot but esteem it the highest insolence: therefore
hereafter no man shall do it merely because he is able,
without any other pretension. But what may serve all
purposes quite as well, it shall be allowed all such who
think riches the chief distinction, to appear in the Ring<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
with two horses only, and a rent-roll hanging out of
each side of their coach. This is a thought of Mr.
Greenhat's, who designs very soon to publish a sumptuary
discourse upon the subject of equipage, wherein he will
give us rules on that subject, and assign the proper
duties and qualifications of masters and servants, as well
as that of husbands and wives; with a treatise of economy
without doors, or the complete art of appearing in the
world. This will be very useful to all who are suddenly
rich, or are ashamed of being poor.</p>

<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 9.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">We have received letters from the Duke of Marlborough's
camp, which bring us further particulars
of the great and glorious victory obtained over the
enemy on the 11th instant, N.S. The number of the
wounded and prisoners is much greater than was expected
from our first account. The day was doubtful
till after twelve o'clock; but the enemy made littl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>e
resistance after their first line on the left began to give
way. An exact narration of the whole affair is expected
next post. The French have had two days allowed
them to bury their dead, and carry off their wounded
men upon parole. Those regiments of Great Britain
which suffered most, are ordered into garrison, and fresh
troops commanded to march into the field. The States
have also directed troops to march out of the towns, to
relieve those who lost so many men in attacking the
second entrenchment of the French in the plain between
Sart and Jansart.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 12.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">No man can conceive, till he comes to try it, how
great a pain it is to be a public-spirited person.
I am sure I am unable to express to the world, how much
anxiety I have suffered, to see of how little benefit my
lucubrations have been to my fellow-subjects. Men will
go on in their own way in spite of all my labour. I
gave Mr. Didapper a private reprimand for wearing red-heeled
shoes, and at the same time was so indulgent as
to connive at him for fourteen days, because I would
give him the wearing of them out; but after all this, I
am informed, he appeared yesterday with a new pair
of the same sort. I have no better success with Mr.
Whatdee'call,<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> as to his buttons: Stentor<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> still roars;
and box and dice rattle as loud as they did before I writ
against them. Partridge<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> walks about at noonday, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>&AElig;sculapius<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> thinks of adding a new lace to his livery.
However, I must still go on in laying these enormities
before men's eyes, and let them answer for going on in
their practice.</p>

<p>My province<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> is much larger than at first sight men
would imagine, and I shall lose no part of my jurisdiction,
which extends not only to futurity, but also is
retrospect to things past; and the behaviour of persons
who have long ago acted their parts, is as much liable to
my examination as that of my own contemporaries.</p>

<p>In order to put the whole race of mankind in their
proper distinctions, according to the opinion their cohabitants
conceived of them, I have, with very much
care, and depth of meditation, thought fit to erect a
Chamber of Fame, and established certain rules, which are
to be observed in admitting members into this illustrious
society.</p>

<p>In this Chamber of Fame there are to be three tables,
but of different lengths: the first is to contain exactly
twelve persons; the second, twenty; the third, an
hundred. This is reckoned to be the full number of
those who have any competent share of fame. At the
first of these tables are to be placed in their order the
twelve most famous persons in the world, not with
regard to the things they are famous for, but according
to the degree of their fame, whether in valour, wit, or
learning. Thus, if a scholar be more famous than a
soldier, he is to sit above him. Neither must any preference
be given to virtue, if the person be not equally
famous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>When the first table is filled, the next in renown must
be seated at the second, and so on in like manner to the
number of twenty; as also in the same order at the
third, which is to hold an hundred. At these tables no
regard is to be had to seniority: for if Julius C&aelig;sar
shall be judged more famous than Romulus and Scipio,
he must have the precedence. No person who has not
been dead an hundred years must be offered to a place
at any of these tables; and because this is altogether a
lay society, and that sacred persons move upon greater
motives than that of fame, no persons celebrated in Holy
Writ, or any ecclesiastical men whatsoever, are to be
introduced here.</p>

<p>At the lower end of the room is to be a side-table for
persons of great fame, but dubious existence, such as
Hercules, Theseus, &AElig;neas, Achilles, Hector, and others.
But because it is apprehended that there may be great
contention about precedence, the proposer humbly desires
the opinion of the learned towards his assistance in placing
every person according to his rank, that none may have
just occasion of offence.</p>

<p>The merits of the cause shall be judged by plurality
of voices.</p>

<p>For the more impartial execution of this important
affair, it is desired that no man will offer his favourite
hero, scholar, or poet; and that the learned will be
pleased to send to Mr. Bickerstaff, at Mr. Morphew's,
near Stationers' Hall, their several lists for the first table
only, and in the order they would have them placed;
after which the composer will compare the several lists,
and make another for the public, wherein every name
shall be ranked according to the voices it has had.
Under this chamber is to be a dark vault for the same
number of persons of evil fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>It is humbly submitted to consideration, whether the
project would not be better if the persons of true fame
meet in a middle room, those of dubious existence in an
upper room, and those of evil fame in a lower dark
room.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that no historians are to be admitted
at any of these tables, because they are appointed to
conduct the several persons to their seats, and are to be
made use of as ushers to the assemblies.</p>

<p>I call upon the learned world to send me their assistance
towards this design, it being a matter of too great
moment for any one person to determine. But I do
assure them, their lists shall be examined with great
fidelity, and those that are exposed to the public, made
with all the caution imaginable.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while I wait for these lists, I am
employed in keeping people in a right way to avoid
the contrary to fame and applause, to wit, blame and
derision. For this end I work upon that useful project
of the penny-post,<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> by the benefit of which it is proposed
that a charitable society be established: from which society
there shall go every day circular letters to all parts within
the bills of mortality, to tell people of their faults in a
friendly and private manner, whereby you may know
what the world thinks of them, before it is declared to
the world that they are thus faulty. This method cannot
fail of universal good consequences: for it is further
added, that they who will not be reformed by it, must b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>e
contented to see the several letters printed, which were
not regarded by them, that when they will not take
private reprehension, they may be tried further by a
public one. I am very sorry I am obliged to print the
following epistles of that kind to some persons, and the
more because they are of the fair sex. This went on
Friday last to a very fine lady.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>


<p class="drop-cap">"I am highly sensible that there is nothing of so tender
a nature as the reputation and conduct of ladies;
and that when there is the least stain got into their fame,
it is hardly ever to be washed out. When I have said
this, you will believe I am extremely concerned to hear
at every visit I make, that your manner of wearing your
hair is a mere affectation of beauty, as well as that your
neglect of powder has been a common evil to your sex.
It is to you an advantage to show that abundance of fine
tresses; but I beseech you to consider that the force of
your beauty, and the imitation of you, costs Eleonora
great sums of money to her tire-woman for false locks,
besides what is allowed to her maid for keeping the
secret that she is grey. I must take leave to add to
this admonition, that you are not to reign above four
months and odd days longer. Therefore I must desire
you to raise and frizz your hair a little, for it is downright
insolence to be thus handsome without art; and
you'll forgive me for entreating you to do now out of
compassion, what you must soon do out of necessity.
I am,</p>

<p>"Madam,</p>
<p class="center">Your most obedient and most humble Servant."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This person dresses just as she did before I writ: as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
does also the lady to whom I addressed the following
billet the same day:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Let me beg of you to take off the patches at the
lower end of your left cheek, and I will allow
two more under your left eye, which will contribute
more to the symmetry of your face; except you would
please to remove the ten black atoms on your ladyship's
chin, and wear one large patch instead of them. If so,
you may properly enough retain the three patches above-mentioned.
I am, &amp;c."</p></blockquote>

<p>This, I thought, had all the civility and reason in the
world in it; but whether my letters are intercepted, or
whatever it is, the lady patches as she used to do. It
is to be observed by all the charitable society, as an
instruction in their epistles, that they tell people of
nothing but what is in their power to mend. I shall
give another instance of this way of writing: Two sisters
in Essex Street are eternally gaping out of the window,
as if they knew not the value of time, or would call in
companions. Upon which I writ the following line:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Creatures</span>,</p>

<p class="center">"On the receipt of this, shut your casements."</p></blockquote>

<p>But I went by yesterday, and found them still at the
window. What can a man do in this case, but go on,
and wrap himself up in his own integrity, with satisfaction
only in this melancholy truth, that virtue is its
own reward, and that if no one is the better for his
admonitions, yet he is himself the more virtuous in that
he gave those advices.</p>

<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 12.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Letters of the 18th instant from the Duke of Marlborough's
camp at Havre advise, that the necessary
dispositions were made for opening the trenches before
Mons. The direction of the siege is to be committed
to the Prince of Orange, who designed to take his post
accordingly with thirty battalions and thirty squadrons
on the day following. On the 17th, Lieutenant-General
Cadogan set out for Brussels, to hasten the ammunition
and artillery which is to be employed in this enterprise;
and the confederate army was extended from the Aisne
to the Trouille, in order to cover the siege. The loss
of the confederates in the late battle is not exactly
known; but it appears by a list transmitted to the
States-General, that the number of the killed and
wounded in their service amounts to about eight thousand.
It is computed that the English have lost 1500
men, and the rest of the allies about five thousand, including
the wounded. The States-General have taken
the most speedy and effectual measures for reinforcing
their troops; and 'tis expected that in eight or ten days
the army will be as numerous as before the battle. The
affairs in Italy afford us nothing remarkable; only that
it is hoped the difference between the Courts of Vienna
and Turin will be speedily accommodated. Letters
from Poland present us with a near prospect of seeing
King Augustus re-established on the throne, all parties
being very industrious to reconcile themselves to his
interests.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Sept. 12.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Of all the pretty arts in which our modern writers
excel, there is not any which is more to be recommended
to the imitation of beginners than the skill of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
transition from one subject to another. I know not
whether I make myself well understood; but it is certain,
that the way of stringing a discourse, used in the
<i>Mercury Gallant</i>,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> the <i>Gentleman's Journal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> and other
learned writings, not to mention how naturally things
present themselves to such as harangue in pulpits, and
other occasions which occur to the learned, are methods
worthy commendation. I shall attempt this style myself
in a few lines. Suppose I were discoursing upon the
King of Sweden's passing the Boristhenes. The Boristhenes
is a great river, and puts me in mind of the
Danube and the Rhine. The Danube I cannot think of
without reflecting on that unhappy prince who had such
fair territories on the banks of it; I mean the Duke of
Bavaria, who by our last letters is retired from Mons.
Mons is as strong a fortification as any which has no
citadel; and places which are not completely fortified,
are, methinks, lessons to princes, that they are not
omnipotent, but liable to the strokes of fortune. But
as all princes are subject to such calamities, it is the
part of men of letters to guard them from the observations
of all small writers: for which reason I shall
conclude my present remarks by publishing the following
advertisement, to be taken notice of by all who dwell
in the suburbs of learning.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Whereas the King of Sweden has been so unfortunate
to receive a wound in his heel; we do hereby prohibit
all epigrammatists in either language, and both universities,
as well as all other poets, of what denominatio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>n
soever, to make any mention of Achilles having received
his death's wound in the same part.</p>

<p>"We do likewise forbid all comparisons in coffee-houses
between Alexander the Great and the said King
of Sweden, and from making any parallels between the
death of Patkul and Philotas;<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> we being very apprehensive
of the reflections that several politicians have
ready by them to produce on this occasion, and being
willing, as much as in us lies, to free the town from all
impertinences of this nature."</p></blockquote>

outlived the injuries of time, and recommended themselves
so far to the world, that it is become learning to
know the least circumstance of their affairs. It is a
great incentive to see that some men have raised themselves
so highly above their fellow-creatures; that the
lives of ordinary men are spent in inquiries after the
particular actions of the most illustrious. True it is,
that without this impulse to fame and reputation, our
industry would stagnate, and that lively desire of pleasing
each other die away. This opinion was so established
in the heathen world, that their sense of living appeared
insipid, except their being was enlivened with a consciousness
that they were esteemed by the rest of the world.
Upon examining the proportion of men's fame for my
table of twelve, I thought it no ill way, since I had laid
it down for a rule, that they were to be ranked simply
as they were famous, without regard to their virtue, to
ask my sister Jenny's advice, and particularly mentioned
to her the name of Aristotle. She immediately told me,
he was a very great scholar, and that she had read him
at the boarding-school. She certainly means a trifle sold
by the hawkers, called "Aristotle's Problems." But this
raised a great scruple in me, whether a fame increased
by imposition of others is to be added to his account,
or that these excrescences, which grow out of his real
reputation, and give encouragement to others to pass
things under the cover of his name, should be considered
in giving him his seat in the chamber? This punctilio
is referred to the learned. In the meantime, so ill-natured
are mankind, that I believe I have names
already sent me sufficient to fill up my lists for the
dark room, and every one is apt enough to send in their
accounts of ill deservers. This malevolence does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
proceed from a real dislike of virtue, but a diabolical
prejudice against it, which makes men willing to destroy
what they care not to imitate. Thus you see the greatest
characters among your acquaintance, and those you live
with, are traduced by all below them in virtue, who never
mention them but with an exception. However, I believe
I shall not give the world much trouble about filling my
tables for those of evil fame, for I have some thoughts
of clapping up the sharpers there as fast as I can lay hold
of them.</p>

<p>At present, I am employed in looking over the several
notices which I have received of their manner of dexterity,
and the way at dice of making all rugg,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> as the
cant is. The whole art of securing a die has lately been
sent me by a person who was of the fraternity, but is
disabled by the loss of a finger, by which means he
cannot practise that trick as he used to do. But I am
very much at a loss how to call some of the fair sex who
are accomplices with the knights of industry; for my
metaphorical dogs are easily enough understood; but
the feminine gender of dog has so harsh a sound, that
we know not how to name it. But I am credibly informed
that there are female dogs as voracious as the
males, and make advances to young fellows, without any
other design but coming to a familiarity with their purses.
I have also long lists of persons of condition, who are
certainly of the same regimen with these banditti, and
instrumental to their cheats upon undiscerning men of
their own rank. These add their good reputation to
carry on the impostures of others, whose very names
would else be defence enough against falling into their
hands. But for the honour of our nation, these shall be
unmentioned, provided we hear no more of such practices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>,
and that they shall not from henceforward suffer the
society of such as they know to be the common enemies
of order, discipline, and virtue. If it appear that they go
on in encouraging them, they must be proceeded against
according to severest rules of history, where all is to
be laid before the world with impartiality, and without
respect to persons.</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, September 14.</i></h3>

<p>I find left here for me the following epistle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Having lately read your discourse about the family of
Trubies,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> wherein you observe that there are some
who fall into laughter out of a certain benevolence in
their temper, and not out of the ordinary motive, viz.,
contempt and triumph over the imperfections of others,
I have conceived a good idea of your knowledge of mankind.
And as you have a tragi-comic genius, I beg the
favour of you to give us your thoughts of a quite
different effect, which also is caused by other motives
than what are commonly taken notice of. What I would
have you treat of, is, the cause of shedding tears. I
desire you would discuss it a little, with observations
upon the various occasions which provoke us to that
expression of our concern, &amp;c."</p></blockquote>

<p>To obey this complaisant gentleman, I know no way
so short as examining the various touches of my own
bosom, on several occurrences in a long life, to the
evening of which I am arrived, after as many variou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>s
incidents as anybody has met with. I have often reflected,
that there is a great similitude in the motions of
the heart in mirth and in sorrow; and I think the usual
occasion of the latter, as well as the former, is something
which is sudden and unexpected. The mind has
not a sufficient time to recollect its force, and immediately
gushes into tears before we can utter ourselves by
speech or complaint. The most notorious causes of
these drops from our eyes, are pity, sorrow, joy, and
reconciliation. The fair sex, who are made of man, and
not of earth, have a more delicate humanity than we
have, and pity is the most common cause of their tears:
for as we are inwardly composed of an aptitude to every
circumstance of life, and everything that befalls any
one person might have happened to any other of human
race, self-love, and a sense of the pain we ourselves should
suffer in the circumstances of any whom we pity, is the
cause of that compassion. Such a reflection in the breast
of a woman immediately inclines her to tears; but in a
man, it makes him think how such a one ought to act
on that occasion, suitable to the dignity of his nature.
Thus a woman is ever moved for those whom she hears
lament, and a man for those whom he observes to suffer
in silence. It is a man's own behaviour in the circumstances
he is under which procures him the esteem of
others, and not merely the affliction itself which demands
our pity: for we never give a man that passion which he
falls into for himself. He that commends himself never
purchases our applause; nor he who bewails himself, our
pity. Going through an alley the other day, I observed
a noisy impudent beggar bawl out, that he was wounded
in a merchantman, that he had lost his poor limbs, and
showed a leg clouted up. All that passed by, made what
haste they could out of sight and hearing. But a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
fellow at the end of the passage, with a rusty coat, a
melancholy air, and a soft voice, desired them to look
upon a man not used to beg. The latter received the
charity of almost every one that went by. The strings
of the heart, which are to be touched to give us compassion,
are not so played on but by the finest hand.
We see in tragical representations it is not the pomp of
language, or magnificence of dress, in which the passion
is wrought that touches sensible spirits, but something
of a plain and simple nature which breaks in upon our
souls, by that sympathy which is given us for our mutual
good-will and service.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> In the tragedy of "Macbeth,"
where Wilks<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> acts the part of a man whose family has
been murdered in his absence, the wildness of his passion,
which is run over in a torrent of calamitous circumstances,
does but raise my spirits, and give me the alarm;
but when he skilfully seems to be out of breath, and is
brought too low to say more, and upon a second reflection,
cry, only wiping his eyes, "What, both children!
Both, both my children gone!" there is no resisting a
sorrow which seems to have cast about for all the reasons
possible for its consolation, but has no recourse. There is
not one left, but both, both are murdered!<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Such
sudden starts from the thread of the discourse, and
a plain sentiment expressed in an artless way,
are the irresistible strokes of eloquence and poetry.
The same great master, Shakespeare, can afford us instances of all
the places where our souls are accessible, and ever commands
our tears; but it is to be observed, that he draws
them from some unexpected source, which seems not wholly
of a piece with the discourse. Thus when Brutus
and Cassius had a debate in the tragedy of "C&aelig;sar," an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>d
rose to warm language against each other, insomuch that
it had almost come to something that might be fatal,
till they recollected themselves; Brutus does more than
make an apology for the heat he had been in, by saying,
"Porcia is dead."<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Here Cassius is all tenderness, and
ready to dissolve, when he considers that the mind of
his friend had been employed on the greatest affliction
imaginable, when he had been adding to it by a debate
on trifles; which makes him in the anguish of his heart
cry out, "How scaped I killing when I thus provoked
you?"<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> This is an incident which moves the soul in all
its sentiments; and Cassius's heart was at once touched
with all the soft pangs of pity, remorse, and reconciliation.
It is said indeed by Horace, "If you would have
me weep, you must first weep yourself."<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> This is not
literally true, for it would have been as rightly said, if
we observe nature, that I shall certainly weep if you do
not; but what is intended by that expression is, that it
is not possible to give passion except you show that you
suffer yourself. Therefore the true art seems to be, that
when you would have the person you represent pitied,
you must show him at once, in the highest grief and
struggling, to bear it with decency and patience. In
this case, we sigh for him, and give him every groan he
suppresses.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> I remember, when I was young enough t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>o
follow the sports of the field, I have more than once
rode off at the death of a deer, when I have seen the
animal in an affliction which appeared human without
the least noise, let fall tears when he was reduced to
extremity; and I have thought of the sorrow I saw him in
when his haunch came to the table. But our tears are
not given only to objects of pity, but the mind has recourse
to that relief on all occasions which give us much
emotion. Thus, to be apt to shed tears is a sign of a
great as well as little spirit. I have heard say, the present
Pope<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> never passes through the people, who always
kneel in crowds and ask his benediction, but the tears
are seen to flow from his eyes. This must proceed from
an imagination that he is the father of all those people,
and that he is touched with so extensive a benevolence
that it breaks out into a passion of tears. You see friends,
who have been long absent, transported in the same manner:
a thousand little images crowd upon them at their
meeting, as all the joys and griefs they have known
during their separation; and in one hurry of thought,
they conceive how they should have participated in those
occasions, and weep, because their minds are too full to
wait the slow expression of words.</p>

<p>There is lately broke loose from the London Pack<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>a
very tall dangerous biter. He is now at the Bath, and
it is feared will make a damnable havoc amongst the
game. His manner of biting is new, and called the Top.
He secures one die betwixt his two fingers: the other
is fixed by the help of a famous wax invented by an
apothecary, since a gamester; a little of which he puts
upon his forefinger, and that holds the die in the box at
his devotion. Great sums have been lately won by these
ways; but it is hoped that this hint of his manner of
cheating will open the eyes of many who are every day
imposed upon.</p>

<p>There is now in the press, and will be suddenly published,
a book entitled "An Appendix to the Contempt of
the Clergy,"<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> wherein will be set forth at large, that all
our dissensions are owing to the laziness of persons in
the sacred ministry, and that none of the present schisms
could have crept into the flock but by the negligence of
the pastors. There is a digression in this treatise, proving
that the pretences made by the priesthood from time
to time that the Church was in danger, is only a trick to
make the laity passionate for that of which they themselves
have been negligent. The whole concludes with
an exhortation to the clergy, to the study of eloquence,
and practice of piety, as the only method to support the
highest of all honours, that of a priest, who lives and acts
according to his character.</p>

Meyerfeldt, and broken upon the wheel in October 1707. In the

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 16.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is, as far as it relates to our present being, the great
end of education to raise ourselves above the vulgar;
but what is intended by the vulgar, is not, methinks,
enough understood. In me, indeed, that word raises a
quite different idea from what it usually does in others;
but perhaps that proceeds from my being old, and beginning
to want the relish of such satisfactions as are the
ordinary entertainment of men. However, such as my
opinion is in this case, I will speak it; because it is
possible that turn of thought may be received by others,
who may reap as much tranquillity from it as I do myself.
It is to me a very great meanness, and something much
below a philosopher, which is what I mean by a gentleman,
to rank a man among the vulgar for the condition
of life he is in, and not according to his behaviour, his
thoughts and sentiments, in that condition. For if a
man be loaded with riches and honours, and in that state
of life has thoughts and inclinations below the meanest
artificer; is not such an artificer, who within his power
is good to his friends, moderate in his demands for his
labour, and cheerful in his occupation, very much superior
to him who lives for no other end but to serve himself,
and assumes a preference in all his words and actions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
those who act their part with much more grace than
himself? Epictetus has made use of the similitude of a
stage-play to human life with much spirit. "It is not,"
says he, "to be considered among the actors, who is
prince, or who is beggar, but who acts prince or beggar
best."<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The circumstance of life should not be that
which gives us place, but our behaviour in that circumstance
is what should be our solid distinction. Thus, a
wise man should think no man above him or below him,
any further than it regards the outward order and discipline
of the world: for if we take too great an idea of
the eminence of our superiors, or subordination of our
inferiors, it will have an ill effect upon our behaviour to
both. But he who thinks no man above him but for his
virtue, none below him but for his vice, can never be
obsequious or assuming in a wrong place, but will frequently
emulate men in rank below him, and pity those
above him. This sense of mankind is so far from a
levelling principle, that it only sets us upon a true basis
of distinction, and doubles the merit of such as become
their condition. A man in power, who can, without the
ordinary prepossessions which stop the way to the true
knowledge and service of mankind, overlook the little
distinctions of fortune, raise obscure merit, and
discountenance successful indesert,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> has, in the minds of knowing
men, the figure of an angel rather than a man, and is
above the rest of men in the highest character he can be,
even that of their benefactor. Turning my thoughts as I
was taking my pipe this evening after this manner, it was
no small delight to me to receive advice from Felicia,<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> that
Eboracensis was appointed a governor of one of thei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>r
plantations.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> As I am a great lover of mankind, I took
part in the happiness of that people who were to be
governed by one of so great humanity, justice, and
honour. Eboracensis has read all the schemes which writers
have formed of government and order, and been long
conversant with men who have the reins in their hands;
so that he can very well distinguish between chimerical
and practical politics. It is a great blessing (when men
have to deal with such different characters in the same
species as those of free-men and slaves) that they who
command have a just sense of human nature itself, by
which they can temper the haughtiness of the master,
and soften the servitude of the slave. "H&aelig; tibi erunt
artes."<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> This is the notion with which those of the plantation
receive Eboracensis: and as I have cast his nativity,
I find it will be a record made of this person's administrations;
and on that part of the shore from whence he
embarks to return from his government, there will be a
monument with these words: "Here the people wept,
and took leave of Eboracensis, the first governor our
mother Felicia sent, who, during his command here,
believed himself her subject."</p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, Sept. 16.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The following letter wants such sudden despatch, that
all things else must wait for this time.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>Sept. 13, equal day and night.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"There are two ladies, who, having a good opinion of
your taste and judgment, desire you to make use
of them in the following particular, which perhaps you
may allow very particular. The two ladies before mentioned
have a considerable time since contracted a more
sincere and constant friendship than their adversaries
the men will allow consistent with the frailty of female
nature; and being from a long acquaintance convinced
of the perfect agreement of their tempers, have thought
upon an expedient to prevent their separation, and cannot
think any so effectual (since it is common for love to
destroy friendship) as to give up both their liberties to
the same person in marriage. The gentleman they have
pitched upon, is neither well-bred nor agreeable, his
understanding moderate, and his person never designed
to charm women; but having so much self-interest in
his nature, as to be satisfied with making double contracts,
upon condition of receiving double fortunes; and
most men being so far sensible of the uneasiness that
one woman occasions, they think him for these reasons
the most likely person of their acquaintance to receive
these proposals. Upon all other accounts, he is the last
man either of them would choose, yet for this preferable
to all the rest. They desire to know your opinion the
next post, resolving to defer further proceeding, till they
have received it. I am, Sir,</p>

<p>"Your unknown, unthought-of,</p>
<p class="center">Humble Servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bridget Eitherside.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>This is very extraordinary, and much might be objected
by me, who am something of a civilian, to the case of
two marrying the same man; but these ladies are, I
perceive, free-thinkers, and therefore I shall speak only
to the prudential part of this design, merely as a philosopher,
without entering into the merit of it in the
ecclesiastical or civil law. These constant friends,
Piledea and Orestea, are at a loss to preserve their friendship
from the encroachments of love, for which end
they have resolved upon a fellow who cannot be the
object of affection or esteem to either, and consequently
cannot rob one of the place each has in her friend's
heart. But in all my reading (and I have read all that
the sages in love have written), I have found the greatest
danger in jealousy. The ladies indeed, to avoid this
passion, choose a sad fellow; but if they would be
advised by me, they had better have each their worthless
man; otherwise, he that was despicable while he was
indifferent to them, will become valuable when he seems
to prefer one to the other. I remember in the history
of Don Quixote of the Manca, there is a memorable
passage which opens to us the weakness of our nature in
such particulars. The Don falls into discourse with a
gentleman<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> whom he calls the Knight of the Green
Cassock, and is invited to his house. When he comes
there, he runs into discourse and panegyric upon the
economy, the government and order of his family, the
education of his children; and lastly, on the singular
wisdom of him who disposed things with that exactness.
The gentleman makes a soliloquy to himself, "Oh irresistible
power of flattery! Though I know this is a
madman, I cannot help being taken with his applause."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<p>The ladies will find this much more true in the case of
their lover; and the woman he most likes, will certainly
be more pleased; she whom he flights, more offended,
than she can imagine before she has tried. Now I humbly
propose, that they both marry coxcombs whom they are
sure they cannot like, and then they may be pretty
secure against the change of affection, which they fear;
and by that means, preserving the temperature under
which they now write, enjoy during life, "equal day and
night."</p>


<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 16.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There is no manner of news; but people now spend
their time in coffee-houses in reflections upon the
particulars of the late glorious day,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> and collecting the
several parts of the action, as they are produced in
letters from private hands, or notices given to us by
accounts in public papers. A pleasant gentleman, alluding
to the great fences through which we pierced, said
this evening, "The French thought themselves on the
right side of the hedge, but it proved otherwise." Mr.
Kidney, who has long conversed with, and filled tea for
the most consummate politicians, was pleased to give me
an account of this piece of ribaldry, and desired me on
that occasion to write a whole paper on the subject of
valour, and explain how that quality, which must be
possessed by whole armies, is so highly preferable in one
man rather than another, and how the same actions are
but mere acts of duty in some, and instances of the most
heroic virtue in others. He advised me not to fail in
this discourse to mention the gallantry of the Prince of
Nassau in this last engagement, who (when a battalio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>n
made a halt in the face of the enemy) snatched the
colours out of the hands of the ensign, and planted
them just before the line of the enemy, calling to that
battalion to take care of their colours, if they had no
regard to him. Mr. Kidney has my promise to obey
him in this particular on the first occasion that offers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff is now compiling exact accounts of
the pay of the militia, and the commission officers
under the respective Lieutenancies of Great Britain: in
the first place, of those of London and Westminster;
and in regard that there are no common soldiers, but all
house-keepers, or representatives of house-keepers in
these bodies, the sums raised by the officers shall be
looked into, and their fellow-soldiers, or rather fellow-travellers
from one part of the town to the other, not
defrauded of the ten pounds allowed for the subsistence
of the troops.</p>

<p>Whereas not very long since, at a tavern between
Fleet Bridge and Charing Cross, some certain polite
gentlemen thought fit to perform the bacchanalian
exercises of devotion, by dancing without clothes on,
after the manner of the pre-Adamites; this is to certify
those persons, that there is no manner of wit or humour
in the said practice, and that the beadles of the parish
are to be at their next meeting, where it is to be examined,
whether they are arrived at want of feeling, as
well as want of shame.</p>

<p>Whereas a chapel clerk was lately taken in a garret
on a flock-bed with two of the fair sex, who are usually
employed in sifting cinders; this is to let him know,
that if he persists in being a scandal both to laity and
clergy (as being as it were both and neither), the names
of the nymphs who were with him shall be printed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
therefore he is desired, as he tenders the reputation of
his ladies, to repent.</p>

<p>Mr. Bickerstaff has received information, that an
eminent and noble preacher in the chief congregation
of Great Britain, for fear of being thought guilty of
presbyterian fervency and extemporary prayer, lately
read his, before sermon; but the same advices acknowledging
that he made the congregation large amends by
the shortness of his discourse, it is thought fit to make
no further observation upon it.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 19.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The following letter,<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> in prosecution of what I have
lately asserted, has urged that matter so much
better than I had, that I insert it as I received it. These
testimonials are customary with us learned men, and
sometimes are suspected to be written by the author;
but I fear no one will suspect me of this.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>London, Sept. 15, 1709.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Having read your lucubrations of the 10th instant,<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
I can't but entirely agree with you in your
notions of the scarcity of men who can either read or
speak. For my part, I have lived these thirty years in
the world, and yet have observed but a very few wh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>o
could do either in any tolerable manner; among which
few, you must understand that I reckon myself. How
far eloquence, set off with the proper ornaments of
voice and gesture, will prevail over the passions, and
how cold and unaffecting the best oration in the world
would be without them, there are two remarkable
instances in the case of Ligarius and that of Milo.
C&aelig;sar had condemned Ligarius. He came indeed to
hear what might be said; but thinking himself his
own master, resolved not to be biassed by anything
Cicero could say in his behalf: but in this he was
mistaken; for when the orator began to speak, the
hero is moved, he is vanquished, and at length the
criminal absolved. It must be observed, that this
famous orator was less renowned for his courage than
his eloquence; for though he came at another time,
prepared to defend Milo with one of the best orations
that antiquity has produced; yet being seized with a
sudden fear by seeing some armed men surrounding the
Forum, he faltered in his speech, and became unable to
exert that irresistible force and beauty of action which
would have saved his client, and for want of which he
was condemned to banishment. As the success the
former of these orations met with, appears chiefly owing
to the life and graceful manner with which it was recited
(for some there are who think it may be read without
transport), so the latter seems to have failed of success
for no other reason, but because the orator was not in a
condition to set it off with those ornaments. It must be
confessed, that artful sound will with the crowd prevail
even more than sense; but those who are masters of
both, will ever gain the admiration of all their hearers:
and there is, I think, a very natural account to be given
of this matter; for the sensation of the head and heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
are caused in each of these parts by the outward organs
of the eye and ear: that therefore which is conveyed to
the understanding and passions by only one of these
organs, will not affect us so much as that which is transmitted
through both.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> I can't but think your charge
is just against a great part of the learned clergy of Great
Britain, who deliver the most excellent discourses with
such coldness and indifference, that it is no great wonder
the unintelligent many of their congregations fall asleep.
Thus it happens that their orations meet with a quite
contrary fate to that of Demosthenes you mentioned;
for as that lost much of its beauty and force by being repeated
to the magistrates of Rhodes without the winning
action of that great orator, so the performances of
these gentlemen never appear with so little grace, and to
so much disadvantage, as when delivered by themselves
from the pulpit. Hippocrates being sent for to a
patient in this city, and having felt his pulse, inquired
into the symptoms of his distemper, and finding that it
proceeded in great measure from want of sleep, advises
his patient, with an air of gravity, to be carried to
church to hear a sermon, not doubting but that it
would dispose him for the rest he wanted. If some
of the rules Horace gives for the theatre, were (not
improperly) applied to our pulpits, we should not hear a
sermon prescribed as a good opiate.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"A man must himself express some concern and affection
in delivering his discourse, if he expects his auditory
should interest themselves in what he proposes: fo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>r
otherwise, notwithstanding the dignity and importance
of the subject he treats of, notwithstanding the weight
and argument of the discourse itself, yet too many will
say,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>"If there be a deficiency in the speaker, there will not
be a sufficient attention and regard paid to the things
spoken: but, Mr. Bickerstaff, you know, that as too little
action is cold, so too much is fulsome. Some indeed
may think themselves accomplished speakers, for no other
reason than because they can be loud and noisy (for surely
Stentor<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> must have some design in his vociferations).
But, dear Mr. Bickerstaff, convince them, that as harsh
and irregular sound is not harmony, so neither is banging
a cushion, oratory; and therefore, in my humble opinion,
a certain divine<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> of the first order, whom I allow otherwise
to be a great man, would do well to leave this off; for I
think his sermons would be more persuasive if he gave
his auditory less disturbance. Though I cannot say that
this action would be wholly improper to a profane
oration, yet I think, in a religious assembly, it gives
a man too warlike, or perhaps too theatrical a figure
to be suitable to a Christian congregation. I am,</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>
<p class="right">Your humble Servant, &amp;c."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most learned and ingenious Mr. Rosehat is also
pleased to write to me on this subject.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I read with great pleasure in the <i>Tatler</i> of Saturday
last the conversation upon eloquence. Permit me
to hint to you one thing the great Roman orator observes
upon this subject, 'Caput enim arbitrabatur oratoris' (he
quotes Menedemus, an Athenian), 'ut ipsis apud quos
ageret talis qualem ipse optaret videretur, id fieri vit&aelig;
dignitate.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> It is the first rule in oratory, that a man
must appear such as he would persuade others to be, and
that can be accomplished only by the force of his life.
I believe it might be of great service to let our public
orators know, that an unnatural gravity, or an unbecoming
levity in their behaviour out of the pulpit, will take
very much from the force of their eloquence in it.
Excuse another scrap of Latin; it is from one of the
Fathers: I think it will appear a just observation to all,
as it may have authority with some: 'Qui autem docent
tantum, nec faciunt, ipsi pr&aelig;ceptis suis detrahunt pondus;
quis enim obtemperet, quum ipsi pr&aelig;ceptores doceant non
obtemperare?' I am,</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>
<p class="right">Your most humble Servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">Jonathan Rosehat.</span></p>

<p>"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;You were complaining in that paper, that the
clergy of Great Britain had not yet learned to speak: a
very great defect indeed; and therefore I shall think
myself a well-deserver of the Church, in recommending
all the dumb clergy to the famous speaking doctor at
Kensington.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> This ingenious gentleman, out of compassio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>n
to those of a bad utterance, has placed his whole
study in the new modelling the organs of voice, which
art he has so far advanced, as to be able even to make a
good orator of a pair of bellows. He lately exhibited
a specimen of his skill in this way, of which I was
informed by the worthy gentlemen then present, who were
at once delighted and amazed to hear an instrument of
so simple an organisation use an exact articulation of
words, a just cadency in its sentences, and a wonderful
pathos in its pronunciation; not that he designs to
expatiate in this practice, because he cannot (as he says)
apprehend what use it may be of to mankind, whose
benefit he aims at in a more particular manner: and for
the same reason he will never more instruct the feathered
kind, the parrot having been his last scholar in that way.
He has a wonderful faculty in making and mending
echoes, and this he will perform at any time for the use
of the solitary in the country, being a man born for
universal good, and for that reason recommended to your
patronage by, Sir, Yours, &amp;c."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>
<p>Another learned gentleman gives me also this encomium:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap">"You are now got into a useful and noble subject;
take care to handle it with judgment and delicacy.
I wish every young divine would give yours of
Saturday last a serious perusal; and now you are entered
upon the action of an orator, if you would proceed to
favour the world with some remarks on the mystical
enchantments of pronunciation, what a secret force there
is in the accents of a tunable voice, and wherefore the
works of two very great men of the profession could
never please so well when read as heard, I shall trouble
you with no more scribble. You are now in the method
of being truly profitable and delightful. If you can keep
up to such great and sublime subjects, and pursue them
with a suitable genius, go on and prosper. Farewell."</p></blockquote>

particular characters, it is thought nothing would more contribute
to the impression you design by such, than always
having regard to truth. In your <i>Tatler</i> of this day,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> I
observe you allow, that nothing is so tender as a lady's
reputation; that a stain once got in their fame, is hardly
ever to be washed out. This you grant even when you give
yourself leave to trifle. If so, what caution is necessary
in handling the reputation of a man, whose wellbeing in
this life perhaps entirely depends on preserving it from
any wound, which once there received, too often becomes
fatal and incurable? Suppose some villainous hand,
through personal prejudice, transmits materials for this
purpose, which you publish to the world, and afterwards
become fully convinced you were imposed on (as by this
time you may be of a character you have sent into the
world); I say, supposing this, I would be glad to know,
what reparation you think ought to be made the person
so injured, admitting you stood in his place. It has
always been held, that a generous education is the surest
mark of a generous mind. The former is indeed perspicuous
in all your papers; and I am persuaded, though
you affect often to show the latter, yet you would not
keep any measures (even of Christianity) with those who
should handle you in the manner you do others. The
application of all this is from your having very latel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>y
glanced at a man, under a character, that were he
conscious to deserve, he would be the first to rid the
world of himself; and would be more justifiable in it to
all sorts of men, than you in your committing such a
violence on his reputation, which perhaps you may be convinced
of in another manner than you deserve from him.</p>

<p>"A man of your capacity, Mr. Bickerstaff, should
have more noble views, and pursue the true spirit of
satire; but I will conclude, lest I grow out of temper,
and will only beg for your own preservation, to remember
the proverb of the pitcher.</p>

<p class="center">"I am Yours,</p>
<p class="right">A. J."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proverb of the pitcher I have no regard to; but
it would be an insensibility not to be pardoned, if a man
could be untouched at so warm an accusation, and that
laid with so much seeming temper. All I can say to it
is, that if the writer, by the same method whereby he
conveyed this letter, shall give me an instance wherein I
have injured any good man, or pointed at anything which
is not the true object of raillery, I shall acknowledge the
offence in as open a manner as the press can do it, and
lay down this paper for ever. There is something very
terrible in unjustly attacking men in a way that may
prejudice their honour or fortune; but when men of too
modest a sense of themselves will think they are touched,
it is impossible to prevent ill consequences from the most
innocent and general discourses. This I have known
happen in circumstances the most foreign to theirs who
have taken offence at them. An advertisement lately
published, relating to Omicron,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> alarmed a gentleman of
good sense, integrity, honour, and industry, which is, i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>n
every particular, different from the trifling pretenders
pointed at in that advertisement. When the modesty of
some is as excessive as the vanity of others, what defence
is there against misinterpretation? However, giving
disturbance, though not intended, to men of virtuous
characters, has so sincerely troubled me, that I will
break from this satirical vein; and to show I very
little value myself upon it, shall for this month ensuing
leave the sharper, the fop, the pedant, the proud man,
the insolent; in a word, all the train of knaves and fools,
to their own devices, and touch on nothing but panegyric.
This way is suitable to the true genius of the Staffs, who
are much more inclined to reward than punish. If
therefore the author of the above-mentioned letter does
not command my silence wholly, as he shall if I do not
give him satisfaction, I shall for the above-mentioned
space turn my thoughts to raising merit from its
obscurity, celebrating virtue in its distress, and attacking
vice by no other method but setting innocence in a
proper light.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Sept. 20.</i></h3>

<p>I find here for me the following letter:<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Squire Bickerstaff</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Finding your advice and censure to have a good effect,
I desire your admonition to our vicar and schoolmaster,
who in his preaching to his auditors, stretches
his jaws so wide, that instead of instructing youth, it
rather frightens them: likewise in reading prayers, he
has such a careless loll, that people are justly offended at
his irreverent posture; besides the extraordinary charg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>e
they are put to in sending their children to dance, to
bring them off of those ill gestures. Another evil
faculty he has, in making the bowling-green his daily
residence, instead of his church, where his curate reads
prayers every day. If the weather is fair, his time is
spent in visiting; if cold or wet, in bed, or at least at
home, though within a hundred yards of the church.
These, out of many such irregular practices, I write for
his reclamation: but two or three things more before I
conclude; to wit, that generally when his curate preaches
in the afternoon, he sleeps sitting in the desk on a hassock.
With all this, he is so extremely proud, that he will go
but once to the sick, except they return his visit."</p></blockquote>

<p>I was going on in reading my letter, when I was
interrupted by Mr. Greenhat, who has been this evening
at the play of "Hamlet." "Mr. Bickerstaff," said he,
"had you been to-night at the play-house, you had
seen the force of action in perfection: your admired
Mr. Betterton<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> behaved himself so well, that, though
now about seventy, he acted youth; and by the prevalen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>t
power of proper manner, gesture and voice, appeared
through the whole drama a young man of great expectation,
vivacity, and enterprise. The soliloquy, where he
began the celebrated sentence of, 'To be, or not to be;'
the expostulation where he explains with his mother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>in her closet; the noble ardour, after seeing his father's
ghost, and his generous distress for the death of Ophelia,
are each of them circumstances which dwell strongly
upon the minds of the audience, and would certainly
affect their behaviour on any parallel occasions in their
own lives. Pray, Mr. Bickerstaff, let us have virtue
thus represented on the stage with its proper ornaments,
or let these ornaments be added to her in places more
sacred. As for my part," said he, "I carried my cousin
Jerry, this little boy, with me, and shall always love the
child for his partiality in all that concerned the fortune of
Hamlet. This is entering youth into the affections and
passions of manhood beforehand, and as it were antedating
the effects we hope from a long and liberal education."</p>

<p>I cannot in the midst of many other things which
press, hide the comfort that this letter from my ingenious
kinsman gives me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap">"I am sorry, though not surprised, to find that you
have rallied the men of dress in vain; that the
amber-headed cane still maintains its unstable post;
that pockets are but a few inches shortened; and a
beau is still a beau, from the crown of his nightcap to
the heels of his shoes. For your comfort, I can assure
you, that your endeavours succeed better in this famous
seat of learning. By them, the manners of our young
gentlemen are in a fair way of amendment, and their
very language is mightily refined. To them it is owing,
that not a servitor will sing a catch, not a senior fellow
make a pun, not a determining bachelor drink a bumper;
and I believe a gentleman commoner would as soon have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the heels of his shoes red as his stockings. When a
witling stands at a coffee-house door, and sneers at those
who pass by, to the great improvement of his hopeful
audience, he is no longer surnamed a slicer, but a man
of fire is the word. A beauty, whose health is drunk
from Heddington to Hinksey,<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> who has been the theme
of the Muses (her cheeks painted with roses, and her
bosom planted with orange boughs), has no more the
title of lady, but reigns an undisputed toast. When to
the plain garb of gown and band a spark adds an inconsistent
long wig, we do not say now he boshes, but
there goes a smart fellow. If a virgin blushes, we no
longer cry the blues. He that drinks till he stares, is no
more tow-row, but honest. A youngster in a scrape, is a
word out of date; and what bright man says, I was Joabed
by the dean: bamboozling is exploded; a shat is a tattler;
and if the muscular motion of a man's face be violent, no
mortal says, he raises a horse, but he is a merry fellow.</p>

conquests; such as Roman emperors lamented they could
not gain; and in which you rival your correspondent

<p><a name="Footnote_172" id="Footnote_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_172"><span class="label">[172]</span></a> Thomas Betterton was born in Westminster about 1635, and was
apprenticed to a bookseller. There are various accounts of how he
came to go on to the stage, but in 1661 he joined Sir William Davenant's
company at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Davenant's son afterwards
gave Betterton a share in the management, and the company ("the
Duke's") moved to Dorset Garden. In 1682 this company united
with the King's company. Betterton lost all his savings in a speculation
in 1692. Soon afterwards the patentee of the theatre quarrelled
with the actors about their salaries, and Betterton and his friends
obtained a licence to set up a theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. Betterton
does not seem to have been a good manager, and he was often
in straitened circumstances. In April 1709 the benefit described in
No. 1 of the <i>Tatler</i> was arranged for his benefit; on that occasion
Betterton, though over seventy, acted the youthful part of Valentine
in "Love for Love." The performance brought Betterton &pound;500.
Writing on the occasion of his death, Steele paid a high tribute to the
actor's powers in No. 167.
</p>
<p>
It is interesting to note what Zachary Baggs, treasurer at Drury
Lane, stated to be the salary paid to, and the amount made by
benefits by, the principal performers. I quote from a rare quarto
paper of two leaves, issued by Baggs in July 1709 upon the threatened
secession of the actors. He says that during the season, October 1708
to June 1709, 135 days&mdash;

<p>
But Baggs adds that at each benefit performance the actor gained
much by the special prices paid for seats, and estimating those extra
profits at the benefits above mentioned at &pound;880, he arrives at the
conclusion that the six actors named earned &pound;1957 in all during the
season, though it was broken in upon by the death of Prince George,
and brought to a premature close in June.</p></div>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, Sept. 23.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have taken upon me no very easy task in turning all
my thoughts on panegyric, when most of the advices
I receive tend to the quite contrary purpose; and I have
few notices but such as regard follies and vices. But
the properest way for me to treat, is to keep in general
upon the passions and affections of men, with as little
regard to particulars as the nature of the thing will
admit. However, I think there is something so passionate
in the circumstances of the lovers mentioned in
the following letter, that I am willing to go out of my
way to obey what is commanded in it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="right"><i>London, September 17.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Your design of entertaining the town with the
characters of the ancient heroes, as persons shall
send an account to Mr. Morphew's, encourages me and
others to beg of you, that in the meantime (if it is not
contrary to the method you have proposed) you would
give us one paper upon the subject of P&aelig;tus and his
wife's death, when Nero sent him an order to kill himself:
his wife setting him the example, died with these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
words, 'P&aelig;tus, it is not painful.' You must know the
story, and your observations upon it will oblige,</p>

<p class="center">"Sir,</p>
<p class="right">Your most humble Servant."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When the worst man that ever lived in the world had
the highest station in it, human life was the object of
his diversion; and he sent orders frequently, out of mere
wantonness, to take off such-and-such, without so much
as being angry with them. Nay, frequently his tyranny
was so humorous, that he put men to death because he
could not but approve of them. It came one day to his
ear, that a certain married couple, P&aelig;tus and Arria, lived
in a more happy tranquillity and mutual love than any
other persons who were then in being. He listened with
great attention to the account of their manner of spending
their time together, of the constant pleasure they
were to each other in all their words and actions; and
found by exact information, that they were so treasonable
as to be much more happy than his Imperial Majesty
himself. Upon which he wrote P&aelig;tus the following
billet:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"P&aelig;tus, you are hereby desired to despatch yourself.
I have heard a very good character of you; and therefore
leave it to yourself, whether you will die by dagger,
sword, or poison. If you outlive this order above an
hour, I have given directions to put you to death by
torture.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Nero.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This familiar epistle was delivered to his wife Arria,
who opened it.</p>

<p>One must have a soul very well turned for love, pity,
and indignation, to comprehend the tumult this unhappy
lady was thrown into upon this occasion. The passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of love is no more to be understood by some tempers
than a problem in a science by an ignorant man: but he
that knows what affection is, will have, upon considering
the condition of Arria, ten thousand thoughts flow in
upon him, which the tongue was not formed to express.
But the charming statue is now before my eyes, and
Arria, in her unutterable sorrow, has more beauty than
ever appeared in youth, in mirth, or in triumph. These
are the great and noble incidents which speak the dignity
of our nature, in our sufferings and distresses. Behold
her tender affection for her husband sinks her features
into a countenance which appears more helpless than
that of an infant: but, again, her indignation shows in
her visage and her bosom a resentment as strong as that
of the bravest man. Long she stood in this agony of
alternate rage and love; but at last composed herself for
her dissolution, rather than survive her beloved P&aelig;tus.
When he came into her presence, he found her with the
tyrant's letter in one hand, and a dagger in the other.
Upon his approach to her, she gave him the order; and
at the same time, stabbing herself, "P&aelig;tus," said she, "it
is not painful," and expired. P&aelig;tus immediately followed
her example. The passion of these memorable lovers
was such, that it eluded the rigour of their fortune, and
baffled the force of a blow, which neither felt, because
each received it for the sake of the other. The woman's
part in this story is by much the more heroic, and has
occasioned one of the best epigrams transmitted to us
from antiquity.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 23.</i></h3>

<p>The boy says, one in a black hat left the following
letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Friend</span>,</p>

<p class="right"><i>19th of the 7th month.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Being of that part of Christians whom men call
Quakers; and being a seeker of the right way,
I was persuaded yesterday to hear one of your most
noted teachers. The matter he treated was the necessity
of well-living, grounded upon a future state. I was
attentive; but the man did not appear in earnest. He
read his discourse (notwithstanding thy rebukes) so
heavily, and with so little air of being convinced himself,
that I thought he would have slept, as I observed
many of his hearers did. I came home unedified, and
troubled in mind. I dipped into the Lamentations, and
from thence turning to the 34th chapter of Ezekiel, I
found these words: 'Woe be to the shepherds of Israel,
that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed
the flock? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the
wool: ye kill them that are fed; but ye feed not the
flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened; neither
have ye healed that which was sick; neither have ye
bound up that which was broken; neither have ye
brought again that which was driven away; neither have
ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with
cruelty have ye ruled them,' &amp;c. Now I pray thee,
friend, as thou art a man skilled in many things, tell me,
who is meant by the diseased, the sick, the broken, the
driven away, and the lost? and whether the prophecy
in this chapter be accomplished, or yet to come to pass?
And thou wilt oblige thy friend, though unknown."</p></blockquote>

<p>This matter is too sacred for this paper; but I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
see what injury it would do any clergyman, to have it in
his eye, and believe, all that are taken from him by his
want of industry, are to be demanded of him. I daresay,
Favonius<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> has very few of these losses. Favonius, in the
midst of a thousand impertinent assailants of the divine
truths, is an undisturbed defender of them. He protects
all under his care, by the clearness of his understanding,
and the example of his life: he visits dying men with the
air of a man who hoped for his own dissolution, and
enforces in others a contempt of this life, by his own
expectation of the next. His voice and behaviour are the
lively images of a composed and well-governed zeal.
None can leave him for the frivolous jargon uttered by
the ordinary teachers among Dissenters, but such who
cannot distinguish vociferation from eloquence, and argument
from railing. He is so great a judge of mankind,
and touches our passions with so superior a command,
that he who deserts his congregation must be a stranger
to the dictates of nature, as well as to those of grace.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>
<p>But I must proceed to other matters, and resolve the
questions of other inquirers; as in the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="right"><i>Heddington, Sept. 19.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Upon reading that part of the <i>Tatler</i>, No. 69, where
mention is made of a certain chapel-clerk, there
arose a dispute, and that produced a wager, whether by
the words chapel-clerk was meant a clergyman or a layman?
By a clergyman, I mean one in holy orders. It
was not that anybody in the company pretended to guess
who the person was; but some asserted, that by Mr.
Bickerstaff's words must be meant a clergyman only:
others said, that those words might have been said of
any clerk of a parish; and some of them more properly,
of a layman. The wager is half-a-dozen bottles of wine;
in which (if you please to determine it) your health, and
all the family of the staffs, shall certainly be drunk;
and you will singularly oblige another very considerable
family. I mean that of</p>

<p class="center">"Your humble Servants,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Trencher-Caps."</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is very customary with us learned men, to find
perplexities where no one else can see any. The honest
gentlemen who wrote me this, are much at a loss to
understand what I thought very plain; and in return,
their epistle is so plain that I can't understand it. This,
perhaps, is at first a little like nonsense; but I desire all
persons to examine these writings with an eye to my
being far gone in the occult sciences; and remember,
that it is the privilege of the learned and the great to be
understood when they please: for as a man of much
business may be allowed to leave company when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
pleases; so one of high learning may be above your
capacity when he thinks fit. But without further
speeches or fooling, I must inform my friends the
Trencher-Caps in plain words, that I meant in the place
they speak of, a drunken clerk of a church: and I will
return their civility among my relations, and drink their

was born in 1663 at Lichfield, the son of a dyer. In 1678 he
was sent to Westminster by Ashmole, and in 1682 was elected to
Christ Church, Oxford, where he became a tutor, and was associated
with Aldrich and Atterbury against Obadiah Walker, the Popish
Master of University College. In 1692 Smalridge became minister
of Tothill Fields Chapel; in 1693 he was collated to a prebend at
Lichfield; in 1700 he was made D.D.; and in 1708 he was appointed
Lecturer at St. Dunstan's-in-the-West. In 1710 he presented Atterbury
to the Upper House of Convocation; in 1711 he became Canon
of Christ Church and Dean of Carlisle; in 1713 Dean of Christ
Church, and in 1714 Bishop of Bristol. He died in 1719, at Christ
Church. Though a Tory, he was not a violent politician, and both
Addison and Steele were his friends. Addison, writing to Swift,
October 1, 1718, says, "The greatest pleasure I have met with for
some months is the conversation of my old friend Dr. Smalridge,
who, since the death of the excellent friend you mention, is to me
the most candid and agreeable of all bishops."</p></div></div>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, Sept. 26.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I cannot express the confusion the following letter gave
me, which I received by Sir Thomas this morning.
There cannot be a greater surprise, than to meet with
sudden enmity in the midst of a familiar and friendly
correspondence; which is my case in relation to this
epistle: and I have no way to purge myself to the world,
but publishing both it and my answer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"You are a very impudent fellow to put me<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> into the

and rot me, I have more money than most fools I have
bubbled. All persons of quality admire me; though,
rot me, if I value a Blue Garter any more than I do a
blue apron. Everybody knows I am brave; therefore
have a care how you provoke</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Did I not very well know your hand, as well by the
spelling as the character, I should not have believed
yours of to-day had come from you. But when
all men are acquainted, that I have had all my intelligence
from you relating to your fraternity, let them pronounce
who is the more impudent.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> I confess I have had a
peculiar tenderness for you, by reason of that luxuriant
eloquence of which you are master, and have treated you
accordingly; for which you have turned your florid
violence against your ancient friend and schoolfellow.
You know in your own conscience, you gave me leave to
touch upon your vein of speaking, provided I hid your
other talents; in which I believed you sincere, because,
like the ancient Sinon,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> you have before now suffered
yourself to be defaced to carry on a plot. Besides, sir,
'Rot me,' language for a person of your present station.
Fie, fie, I am really ashamed for you, and I shall n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>o
more depend upon your intelligence. Keep your temper,
wash your face, and go to bed.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>For aught I know, this fellow may have confused the
description of the pack, on purpose to ensnare the game,
while I have all along believed he was destroying them
as well as myself. But because they pretend to bark
more than ordinary, I shall let them see, that I will not
throw away the whip, until they know better how to
behave themselves. But I must not at the same time
omit the praises of their economy expressed in the
following advice:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>
<p class="right"><i>Sept. 17.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Though your thoughts are at present employed
upon the tables of fame, and marshalling your
illustrious dead, it is hoped the living may not be neglected,
nor defrauded of their just honours: and since you have
begun to publish to the world the great sagacity and
vigilance of the knights of the industry, it will be expected
you should proceed to do justice to all the
societies of them you can be informed of, especially since
their own great industry covers their actions as much as
possible from that public notice which is their due.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Hidden vice, and concealed virtue, are much alike.</p>

<p>"Be pleased therefore to let the following memoirs
have a place in their history.</p>

<p>"In a certain part of the town, famous for the freshes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>t
oysters and the plainest English, there is a house, or rather
a college, sacred to hospitality, and the industrious arts.
At the entrance is hieroglyphically drawn, a cavalier contending
with a monster, with jaws expanded, just ready to
devour him.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>"Hither the brethren of the industry resort; but to
avoid ostentation, they wear no habits of distinction, and
perform their exercises with as little noise and show as
possible. Here are no undergraduates, but each is a
master of his art. They are distributed according to
their various talents, and detached abroad in parties,
to divide the labours of the day. They have dogs as
well nosed and as fleet as any, and no sportsmen show
greater activity. Some beat for the game, some hunt it,
others come in at the death; and my honest landlord
makes very good venison sauce, and eats his share of the
dinner.</p>

<p>"I would fain pursue my metaphors; but a venerable
person who stands by me, and waits to bring you this
letter, and whom, by a certain benevolence in his look,
I suspect to be Pacolet, reproves me, and obliges me to
write in plainer terms; that the society had fixed their
eyes on a gay young gentleman who has lately succeeded
to a title and an estate; the latter of which they judged
would be very convenient for them. Therefore, after
several attempts to get into his acquaintance, my landlord
finds an opportunity to make his court to a friend of the
young spark's, in the following manner:</p>

<p>"'Sir, as I take you to be a lover of ingenuity and
plain-dealing, I shall speak very freely to you. In few
words then, you are acquainted with Sir Liberal Brisk.
Providence has for our emolument sent him a fair estate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>,
for men are not born for themselves. Therefore, if
you'll bring him to my house, we will take care of
him, and you shall have half the profits. There's Ace
and Cutter will do his business to a hair. You'll tell
me, perhaps, he's your friend: I grant it, and it is for
that I propose it, to prevent his falling into ill hands.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'<i>We'll carve him like a dish fit for the gods,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Not hew him like a carcass fit for hounds.</i><a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"'In short, there are to my certain knowledge a
hundred mouths open for him. Now if we can secure
him to ourselves, we shall disappoint all those rascals
that don't deserve him. Nay, you need not start at it,
sir, it is for your own advantage. Besides, Partridge has
cast me his nativity, and I find by certain destiny, his
oaks must be felled.'</p>

<p>"The gentleman to whom this honest proposal was
made, made little answer; but said he would consider of
it, and immediately took coach to find out the young
baronet, and told him all that had passed, together with
the new salvo to satisfy a man's conscience in sacrificing
his friend. Sir Brisk was fired, swore a dozen oaths, drew
his sword, put it up again, called for his man, beat him,
and bade him fetch a coach. His friend asked him, what
he designed, and whither he was going? He answered,
to find out the villains and fight them. To which his
friend agreed, and promised to be his second, on condition
he would first divide his estate to them, and reserve
only a proportion to himself, that so he might have the
justice of fighting his equals. His next resolution was
to play with them, and let them see he was not the bubble
they took him for. But he soon quitted that, and resolved
at last to tell Bickerstaff of them, and get the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>m
enrolled in the order of the industry, with this caution
to all young landed knights and squires, that whenever
they are drawn to play, they would consider it as calling
them down to a sentence already pronounced upon them,
and think of the sound of those words, 'His oaks must be
felled.'<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> I am,</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 26.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is wonderful to consider to what a pitch of confidence
this world is arrived: do people believe I am
made up of patience? I have long told them, that I will
suffer no enormity to pass, without I have an understanding
with the offenders by way of hush-money; and
yet the candidates at Queenhithe send all the town
coals but me. All the public papers have had this
advertisement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">

<i>London, Sept. 22, 1709.</i></p>

<h4><i>To the Electors of an Alderman for the Ward of Queenhithe.</i><a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></h4>

<p class="drop-cap">"Whereas an evil and pernicious custom has of late
very much prevailed at the election of aldermen
for this city, by treating at taverns and alehouses, thereb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>y
engaging many unwarily to give their votes: which
practice appearing to Sir Arthur de Bradly to be of
dangerous consequence to the freedom of elections, he
hath avoided the excess thereof. Nevertheless, to make
an acknowledgment to this ward for their intended
favour, he hath deposited in the hands of Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, one
of the present Common Council, four hundred and fifty
pounds, to be disposed of as follows, provided the said
Sir Arthur de Bradly be the alderman, viz.</p>

<p>"All such that shall poll for Sir Arthur de Bradly,
shall have one chaldron of good coals gratis.</p>

<p>"And half a chaldron to every one that shall not poll
against him.</p>

<p>"And the remainder to be laid out in a clock, dial, or
otherwise, as the Common Council-men of the said ward
shall think fit.</p>

<p>"And if any person shall refuse to take the said coals
to himself, he may assign the same to any poor electors
in the ward.</p>

<p>"I do acknowledge to have received the said four
hundred and fifty pounds, for the purposes above
mentioned, for which I have given a receipt.</p>

<p>"<i>N.B.</i>&mdash;Whereas several persons have already engaged
to poll for Sir Humphry Greenhat, it is hereby further
declared, that every such person as doth poll for Sir
Humphry Greenhat, and doth also poll for Sir Arthur
de Bradly, shall each of them receive a chaldron of coals
gratis, on the proviso above mentioned."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is certainly the most plain dealing that ever was
used, except that the just quantity which an elector may
drink without excess, and the difference between an acknowledgment
and a bribe, wants explanation. Another
difficulty with me is, how a man who is bargained with
for a chaldron of coals for his vote, shall be said to have
that chaldron gratis? If my kinsman Greenhat had given
me the least intimation of his design, I should have prevented
his publishing nonsense; nor should any knight
in England have put my relation at the bottom of the
leaf as a postscript, when after all it appears Greenhat has
been the more popular man. There is here such open
contradiction, and clumsy art to palliate the matter, and
prove to the people, that the freedom of election is safer
when laid out in coals, than strong drink, that I can turn
this only to a religious use, and admire the dispensation
of things; for if these fellows were as wise as they are
rich, where would soon be our liberty? This reminds
me of a memorable speech<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> made to a city almost in the
same latitude with Westminster. "When I think of your
wisdom, I admire your wealth; when I think of your
wealth, I admire your wisdom."</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 28.</i></h3>

<p>The following letter has given me a new sense of the
nature of my writings. I have the deepest regard to
conviction, and shall never act against it. However, I
do not yet understand what good man he thinks I have
injured: but his epistle has such weight in it, that I
shall always have respect for his admonition, and desire
the continuance of it. I am not conscious that I have
spoken any faults a man may not mend if he pleases.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>Sept. 25.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"When I read your paper of Thursday,<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> I was surprised
to find mine of the 13th inserted at large;
I never intended myself or you a second trouble of this
kind, believing I had sufficiently pointed out the man
you had injured, and that by this time you were convinced
that silence would be the best answer; but finding
your reflections are such as naturally call for a reply, I
take this way of doing it; and, in the first place, return
you thanks for the compliment made me of my seeming
sense and worth. I do assure you, I shall always
endeavour to convince mankind of the latter, though
I have no pretence to the former. But to come a little
nearer, I observe you put yourself under a very severe
restriction, even the laying down the <i>Tatler</i> for ever, if I
can give you an instance, 'wherein you have injured any
good man, or pointed at anything which is not the true
object of raillery.'</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>
<p>"I must confess, Mr. Bickerstaff, if the making a man
guilty of vices that would shame the gallows, be the
best methods to point at the true object of raillery, I
have until this time been very ignorant; but if it be so,
I will venture to assert one thing, and lay it down as a
maxim, even to the Staffian race, viz., that that method
of pointing ought no more to be pursued, than those
people ought to cut your throat who suffer by it,
because I take both to be murder, and the law is not in
every private man's hands to execute: but indeed, sir,
were you the only person would suffer by the <i>Tatler's</i>
discontinuance, I have malice enough to punish you in
the manner you prescribe; but I am not so great an
enemy to the town or my own pleasures, as to wish it;
nor that you would lay aside lashing the reigning vices,
so long as you keep to the true spirit of satire, without
descending to rake into characters below its dignity; for
as you well observe, 'there is something very terrible in
unjustly attacking men in a way that may prejudice their
honour or fortune;' and indeed, where crimes are
enormous, the delinquent deserves little pity, yet the
reporter may deserve less: and here I am naturally led
to that celebrated author of 'The Whole Duty of Man,'
who hath set this matter in a true light in his treatise of
'The Government of the Tongue;'<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> where, speaking of
uncharitable truths, he says, a discovery of this kind
serves not to reclaim, but enrage the offender, and
precipitate him into further degrees of ill. Modesty
and fear of shame is one of those natural restraints,
which the wisdom of heaven has put upon mankind;
and he that once stumbles, may yet by a check of that
bridle recover again: but when by a public detection h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>e
is fallen under that infamy he feared, he will then be apt
to discard all caution, and to think he owes himself the
utmost pleasures of vice, as the price of his reputation.
Nay, perhaps he advances further, and sets up for a
reversed sort of fame, by being eminently wicked, and
he who before was but a clandestine disciple, becomes a
doctor of impiety, &amp;c. This sort of reasoning, sir, most
certainly induced our wise legislators very lately to
repeal that law which put the stamp of infamy in the
face of felons; therefore you had better give an act of
oblivion to your delinquents, at least for transportation,
than continue to mark them in so notorious a manner.
I cannot but applaud your designed attempt of raising
merit from obscurity, celebrating virtue in distress, and
attacking vice in another method, by setting innocence
in a proper light. Your pursuing these noble themes,
will make a greater advance to the reformation you
seem to aim at, than the method you have hitherto
taken, by putting mankind beyond the power of retrieving
themselves, or indeed to think it possible. But
if after all your endeavours in this new way, there should
then remain any hardened impenitents, you must even

<h3><i>Grecian Coffee-house, Sept. 29.</i><a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">This evening I thought fit to notify to the literati of
this house, and by that means to all the world,
that on Saturday the 15th of October next ensuing, I
design to fix my first table of fame;<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> and desire that
such as are acquainted with the characters of the twelve
most famous men that have ever appeared in the world,
would send in their lists, or name any one man for that
table, assigning also his place at it before that time,
upon pain of having such his man of fame postponed,
or placed too high for ever. I shall not, upon any
application whatsoever, alter the place which upon that
day I shall give to any of these worthies. But whereas
there are many who take upon them to admire this hero,
or that author, upon second-hand, I expect each subscriber
should underwrite his reason for the place he allots his
candidate.</p>

<p>The thing is of the last consequence; for we are
about settling the greatest point that has ever been debated
in any age, and I shall take precautions accordingly.
Let every man who votes consider, that he is now going
to give away that, for which the soldier gave up his rest,
his pleasure, and his life; the scholar resigned his whole
series of thought, his midnight repose, and his morning
slumbers. In a word, he is (as I may say) to be judge
of that after-life, which noble spirits prefer to their very
real being. I hope I shall be forgiven therefore, if I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>make some objections against their jury as they shall
occur to me. The whole of the number by whom they
are to be tried, are to be scholars. I am persuaded also,
that Aristotle will be put up by all of that class of men.
However, in behalf of others, such as wear the livery of
Aristotle, the two famous universities are called upon on
this occasion; but I except the men of Queen's, Exeter,
and Jesus Colleges,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> in Oxford, who are not to be
electors, because he shall not be crowned from an implicit
faith in his writings, but to receive his honour
from such judges as shall allow him to be censured.
Upon this election (as I was just now going to say) I
banish all who think and speak after others to concern
themselves in it. For which reason all illiterate distant
admirers are forbidden to corrupt the voices, by sending,
according to the new mode, any poor students coals and
candles for their votes<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> in behalf of such worthies as
they pretend to esteem. All news-writers are also excluded,
because they consider fame as it is a report which
gives foundation to the filling up their rhapsodies, and
not as it is the emanation or consequence of good and
evil actions. These are excepted against as justly as
butchers in case of life and death: their familiarity with
the greatest names takes off the delicacy of their regard,
as dealing in blood makes the <i>lanii</i> less tender of
spilling it.</p>


<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, Sept. 28.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Letters from Lisbon of the 25th inst., N. S., speak of
a battle which has been fought near the river Cinca,
in which General Staremberg had overthrown the army o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>f
the Duke of Anjou. The persons who send this, excuse
their not giving particulars, because they believed an
account must have arrived here before we could hear
from them. They had advices from different parts, which
concurred in the circumstances of the action; after which
the army of his Catholic Majesty advanced as far as Fraga,
and the enemy retired to Saragossa. There are reports
that the Duke of Anjou was in the engagement; but
letters of good authority say, that prince was on the road
towards the camp when he received the news of the defeat
of his troops. We promise ourselves great consequences
from such an advantage, obtained by so accomplished a
general as Staremberg; who, among the men of this
present age, is esteemed the third in military fame and
reputation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_189" id="Footnote_189"></a><a href="#FNanchor_189"><span class="label">[189]</span></a> Henry Winstanley, son of Hamlet Winstanley, the projector and
builder of Eddystone light-house, was designed for a painter, but became
an engraver, and clerk of the works at Audley Inn in 1694, and New-market
in 1700. Walpole supposes that he learned in Italy the tricks
and contrivances which amused the public at Piccadilly and Littlebury.
</p>
<p>
Winstanley's mathematical water theatre stood at the lower end of
Piccadilly, distinguishable by a windmill at the top. The exhibitions
here were diversified to suit the seasons and the company; and the
prices, except that of the sixpenny gallery, varied accordingly. Boxes
were from four shillings to half-a-crown, pit from three to two shillings,
and a seat in the shilling gallery sometimes cost eighteen-pence. The
quantity of water used on extraordinary occasions was from 300 to
800 tons. Winstanley had another house of this sort at Littlebury,
in Essex, where there were similar exhibitions. On his death, his
houses came into the possession of his widow, for whose benefit they
were shown in 1713.
</p>
<p>
From contemporary advertisements we learn, that the mathematical
barrel was at times turned into a tavern, and supplied the company
with different sorts of wine, biscuits, spa-water, and cold tankards;
it was also converted into a coffee-house, and a flying cupid presented
tea, coffee, and newspapers to the gentlemen; fruits, flowers, and
sweetmeats to the ladies. In the month of May there was the addition
of a May-pole and garland, a milkmaid, a fiddler, and syllabubs.
Soft music was heard at a distance, or sirens sung on the rocks. An
advertisement in the <i>Daily Courant</i> for Jan. 20, 1713, speaks of
"great additions, to the expense of 300 tons of water, and fire mingling
with the water, and two flying boys, and a flaming torch with water
flowing out of the burning flame."</p></div>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Sept. 30.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I am called off from public dissertations by a domestic
affair of great importance, which is no less than the
disposal of my sister Jenny for life. The girl is a girl of
great merit, and pleasing conversation; but I being born
of my father's first wife, and she of his third, she converses
with me rather like a daughter than a sister. I
have indeed told her, that if she kept her honour, and
behaved herself in such manner as became the Bickerstaffs,
I would get her an agreeable man for her husband; whic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>h
was a promise I made her after reading a passage in
Pliny's Epistles.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> That polite author had been employed
to find out a consort for his friend's daughter, and gives
the following character of the man he had pitched upon:</p>

<p>"Aciliano plurimum vigoris et industri&aelig; quanqum in
maxima verecundia: est illi facies liberalis, multo sanguine,
multo rubore, suffusa: est ingenua totius corporis
pulchritudo, et quidum senatorius decor, qu&aelig; ego nequaquam
arbitror negligenda: debet enim hoc castitati puellarum
quasi pr&aelig;mium dari."</p>

<p>"Acilianus (for that was the gentleman's name) is a
man of extraordinary vigour and industry, accompanied
with the greatest modesty. He has very much of the
gentleman, with a lively colour, and flush of health in his
aspect. His whole person is finely turned, and speaks
him a man of quality: which are qualifications that, I
think, ought by no means to be overlooked, and should be
bestowed on a daughter as the reward of her chastity."</p>

<p>A woman that will give herself liberties, need not put
her parents to so much trouble; for if she does not
possess these ornaments in a husband, she can supply
herself elsewhere. But this is not the case of my sister
Jenny, who, I may say without vanity, is as unspotted
a spinster as any in Great Britain. I shall take this
occasion to recommend the conduct of our own family
in this particular.</p>

<p>We have in the genealogy of our house, the descriptions
and pictures of our ancestors from the time of
King Arthur; in whose days there was one of my own
name, a Knight of his Round Table, and known by the
name of Sir Isaac Bickerstaff. He was low of stature,
and of a very swarthy complexion, not unlike a
Portuguese Jew. But he was more prudent tha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>n
men of that height usually are, and would often communicate
to his friends his design of lengthening and
whitening his posterity. His eldest son Ralph, for that
was his name, was for this reason married to a lady who
had little else to recommend her, but that she was very
tall and very fair. The issue of this match, with the
help of high shoes, made a tolerable figure in the next
age; though the complexion of the family was obscure
until the fourth generation from that marriage. From
which time, till the reign of William the Conqueror,
the females of our house were famous for their needlework
and fine skins. In the male line, there happened
an unlucky accident in the reign of Richard the Third;
the eldest son of Philip, then chief of the family, being
born with an hump-back and very high nose. This was
the more astonishing, because none of his forefathers
ever had such a blemish; nor indeed was there any in
the neighbourhood of that make, except the butler, who
was noted for round shoulders, and a Roman nose:
what made the nose the less excusable, was the remarkable
smallness of his eyes.</p>

<p>These several defects were mended by succeeding
matches; the eyes were opened in the next generation,
and the hump fell in a century and a half; but the
greatest difficulty was, how to reduce the nose; which
I do not find was accomplished till about the middle of
Henry the Seventh's reign, or rather the beginning of
that of Henry the Eighth.</p>

<p>But while our ancestors were thus taken up in
cultivating the eyes and nose, the face of the Bickerstaffs
fell down insensibly into chin; which was not taken
notice of (their thoughts being so much employed upon
the more noble features) till it became almost too long to
be remedied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>But length of time, and successive care in our alliances,
have cured this also, and reduced our faces into that
tolerable oval which we enjoy at present. I would not
be tedious in this discourse, but cannot but observe,
that our race suffered very much about three hundred
years ago, by the marriage of one of our heiresses with
an eminent courtier, who gave us spindle-shanks, and
cramps in our bones, insomuch that we did not recover
our health and legs till Sir Walter Bickerstaff married
Maud the milkmaid, of whom the then Garter King-at-arms
(a facetious person) said pleasantly enough, that
she had spoiled our blood, but mended our constitutions.
After this account of the effect our prudent choice of
matches has had upon our persons and features, I cannot
but observe, that there are daily instances of as great
changes made by marriage upon men's minds and
humours. One might wear any passion out of a family
by culture, as skilful gardeners blot a colour out of a
tulip that hurts its beauty. One might produce an
affable temper out of a shrew, by grafting the mild upon
the choleric; or raise a Jack-pudding from a prude, by
inoculating mirth and melancholy. It is for want of
care in the disposing of our children, with regard to our
bodies and minds, that we go into a house and see such
different complexions and humours in the same race and
family. But to me it is as plain as a pikestaff, from
what mixture it is, that this daughter silently lowers,
the other steals a kind look at you, a third is exactly well
behaved, a fourth a splenetic, and a fifth a coquette.
In this disposal of my sister, I have chosen, with an eye
to her being a wit, and provided, that the bridegroom
be a man of a sound and excellent judgment, who will
seldom mind what she says when she begins to harangue:
for Jenny's only imperfection is an admiration of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
parts, which inclines her to be a little, but a very little,
sluttish; and you are ever to remark, that we are apt to
cultivate most, and bring into observation, what we
think most excellent in ourselves, or most capable of
improvement. Thus my sister, instead of consulting
her glass and her toilet for an hour and a half after her
private devotion, sits with her nose full of snuff,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> and a
man's nightcap on her head, reading plays and romances.
Her wit she thinks her distinction; therefore knows
nothing of the skill of dress, or making her person
agreeable. It would make you laugh to see me often
with my spectacles on lacing her stays; for she is so
very a wit, that she understands no ordinary thing in
the world. For this reason I have disposed of her to a
man of business, who will soon let her see, that to be
well dressed, in good humour, and cheerful in the
command of her family, are the arts and sciences of
female life. I could have bestowed her upon a fine
gentleman, who extremely admired her wit, and would
have given her a coach and six: but I found it absolutely
necessary to cross the strain; for had they met, they had
eternally been rivals in discourse, and in continual contention
for the superiority of understanding, and brought
forth critics, pedants, or pretty good poets. As it is, I
expect an offspring fit for the habitation of city, town, or
country; creatures that are docile and tractable in whatever
we put them to. To convince men of the necessity
of taking this method, let but one, even below the skill
of an astrologer, behold the turn of faces he meets as
soon as he passes Cheapside Conduit, and you see a deep
attention and a certain unthinking sharpness in every
countenance. They look attentive, but their thoughts
are engaged on mean purposes. To me it is ver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>y
apparent when I see a citizen pass by, whether his head
is upon woollen, silks, iron, sugar, indigo, or stocks.
Now this trace of thought appears or lies hid in the
race for two or three generations. I know at this time
a person of a vast estate, who is the immediate descendant
of a fine gentleman, but the great-grandson of a broker,
in whom his ancestor is now revived. He is a very
honest gentleman in his principles, but can't for his
blood talk fairly: he is heartily sorry for it; but he
cheats by constitution, and overreaches by instinct.</p>

<p>The happiness of the man who marries my sister will
be, that he has no faults to correct in her but her own,
a little bias of fancy, or particularity of manners, which
grew in herself, and can be amended by her. From such
an untainted couple, we can hope to have our family
rise to its ancient splendour of face, air, countenance,
manner, and shape, without discovering the product of
ten nations in one house. There is Obadiah Greenhat
says, he never comes into any company in England, but
he distinguishes the different nations of which we are
composed: there is scarce such a living creature as a
true Briton. We sit down indeed all friends, acquaintance,
and neighbours; but after two bottles, you see a
Dane start up and swear, the kingdom is his own. A
Saxon drinks up the whole quart, and swears, he'll dispute
that with him. A Norman tells them both, he'll assert
his liberty: and a Welshman cries, they are all foreigners
and intruders of yesterday, and beats them out of the
room. Such accidents happen frequently among neighbours'
children, and cousins-german. For which reason I
say, study your race, or the soil of your family will dwindle
into cits or squires, or run up into wits or madmen<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 3.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is a thing very much to be lamented, that a man
must use a certain cunning to speak to people of
what it is their interest to avoid. All men will allow,
that it is a great and heroic work to correct men's errors,
and at the price of being called a common enemy, to go
on in being a common friend to my fellow-subjects and
citizens. But I am forced in this work to revolve the
same thing in ten thousand lights, and cast them in as
many forms, to come at men's minds and affections, in
order to lead the innocent in safety, as well as disappoint
the artifices of betrayers. Since therefore I can make
no impression upon the offending side, I shall turn my
observations upon the offended: that is to say, I must
whip my children for going into bad company, instead
of railing at bad company for ensnaring my children.
The greatest misfortunes men fall into, arise from themselves;
and that temper, which is called very often,
though with great injustice, good-nature, is the source of
a numberless train of evils. For which reason we are to
take this as a rule, that no action is commendable which
is not voluntary; and we have made this a maxim&mdash;that
man who is commonly called good-natured, is hardly to
be thanked for anything he does, because half that is
acted about him, is done rather by his sufferance than
approbation. It is generally a laziness of disposition,
which chooses rather to let things pass the worst way,
than to go through the pain of examination. It
must be confessed, such a one has so great a benevolence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
in him, that he bears a thousand uneasinesses, rather
than he will incommode others; nay, often when he has
just reason to be offended, chooses to sit down with a
small injury, than bring it into reprehension, out of pure
compassion to the offender. Such a person has it usually
said of him, he is no man's enemy but his own; which
is in effect saying, he is a friend to every man but himself
and his friends: for by a natural consequence of his
neglecting himself, he either incapacitates himself to be
another's friend, or makes others cease to be his. If I
take no care of my own affairs, no man that is my friend
can take it ill if I am negligent also of his. This soft
disposition, if it continues uncorrected, throws men into
a sea of difficulties. There is Euphusius, with all the
good qualities in the world, deserves well of nobody:
that universal good-will which is so strong in him, exposes
him to the assault of every invader upon his time, his
conversation, and his property. His diet is butcher's
meat, his wenches are in plain pinners and Norwich
crapes,<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> his dress like other people, his income great, and
yet has he seldom a guinea at command. From these
easy gentlemen, are collected estates by servants or gamesters;
which latter fraternity are excusable, when we
think of this clan, who seem born to be their prey. All
therefore of the family of Act&aelig;on<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> are to take notice,
that they are hereby given up to the brethren of the
industry, with this reserve only, that they are to be
marked as stricken deer, not for their own sakes, but
to preserve the herd from following them and coming
within the scent. I am obliged to leave this importan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>t
subject, without telling whose quarters are severed, who
has the humbles, who the haunch, and who the legs, of
the last stag that was pulled down; but this is only
deferred in hopes my deer will make their escape without
more admonitions or examples, of which they have had
(in mine and the town's opinion) too great a plenty. I
must, I say, at present go to other matters of moment.</p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, October 3.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The lady has answered the letter of Mr. Alexander
Landlord, which was published on Thursday last,<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>
but in such a manner as I do not think fit to proceed in
the affair; for she has plainly told him, that love is her
design, but marriage her aversion. Bless me! What is
this age come to, that people can think to make a pimp
of an astronomer? I shall not promote such designs,
but shall leave her to find out her admirer, while I speak
to another case sent to me by a letter of September 30,
subscribed Lovewell Barebones, where the author desires
me to suspend my care of the dead, till I have done
something for the dying. His case is, that the lady he
loves is ever accompanied by a kinswoman, one of those
gay, cunning women, who prevent all the love which is
not addressed to themselves. This creature takes upon
her in his mistress's presence to ask him, whether Mrs.
Florimel (that is the cruel one's name) is not very handsome;
upon which he looks silly; then they both laugh
out, and she will tell him, that Mrs. Florimel had an
equal passion for him, but desired him not to expect
the first time to be admitted in private; but that now
he was at liberty before her only, who was her friend, to
speak his mind, and that his mistress expected it. Upo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>n
which Florimel acts a virgin-confusion, and with some
disorder waits his speech. Here ever follows a deep
silence; after which a loud laugh. Mr. Barebones applies
himself to me on this occasion. All the advice I can
give him is, to find a lover for the confidant, for there is
no other bribe will prevail; and I see by her carriage,
that it is no hard matter, for she is too gay to have a
particular passion, or to want a general one.</p>

<p>Some days ago the town had a full charge laid against
my Essays, and printed at large. I altered not one word
of what he of the contrary opinion said; but have blotted
out some warm things said for me; therefore please to
hear the counsel for the defendant, though I shall be so
no otherwise than to take a middle way, and, if possible,
keep commendations from being insipid to men's taste,
or raillery pernicious to their characters.</p>

errors he assigns in it, I think, are comprised in the desperation
men are generally driven to, when by a public
detection they fall under the infamy they feared, who
otherwise, by checking their bridle, might have recovered
their stumble, and through a self-conviction become their
own reformers: so he that was before but a clandestine

guessing will serve turn, for there are more
than one to pretend to any of your characters; but there
must at least be something that must amount to a nominal
description, before even common fame can separate me
from the rest of mankind to dart at. A general representation
of an action, either ridiculous or enormous, may
make those wince who find too much similitude in the
character with themselves to plead not guilty; but none
but a witness to the crime can charge them with the guilt,
whilst the indictment is general, and the offender has the
asylum of the whole world to protect him. Here can
then be no injustice, where no one is injured; for it is
themselves must appropriate the saddle, before scandal
can ride them. Your method then, in my opinion, is no
way subject to the charge brought against it; but on the
contrary, I believe this advantage is too often drawn from
it, that whilst we laugh at, or detest the uncertain subject
of the satire, we often find something in the error a
parallel to ourselves; and being insensibly drawn to the
comparison we would get rid of, we plunge deeper into
the mire, and shame produces that which advice has been
too weak for; and you, sir, get converts you never thought
of. As for descending to characters below the dignity
of satire, what men think are not beneath commission, I
must assure him, I think are not beneath reproof: for as
there is as much folly in a ridiculous deportment, as there
is enormity in a criminal one, so neither the one nor the
other ought to plead exemption. The kennel of curs
are as much enemies to the state, as Gregg<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> for his confederacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>;
for as this betrayed our Government, so the
other does our property, and one without the other is
equally useless. As for the act of oblivion he so strenuously
insists on, <i>Le Roi s'avisera</i> is a fashionable answer;
and for his modus of panegyric, the hint was unnecessary,
where Virtue need never ask twice for her laurel. But
as for his reformation by opposites, I again must ask his
pardon, if I think the effects of these sort of reasonings
(by the paucity of converts) are too great an argument,
both of their imbecility and unsuccessfulness, to believe
it will be any better than misspending of time, by suspending
a method that will turn more to advantage, and
which has no other danger of losing ground, but by discontinuance.
And as I am certain (of what he supposes)
that your lucubrations are intended for the public benefit,
so I hope you will not give them so great an interruption,
by laying aside the only method that can render you
beneficial to mankind, and (among others) agreeable to,</p>

<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, October 3.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Letters from the camp at Havre on the 7th instant,
N.S., advise, that the trenches were opened before
Mons on the 27th of last month, and the approaches
were carried on at two attacks with great application
and success, notwithstanding the rains which had fallen;
that the besiegers had made themselves masters of
several redoubts, and other outworks, and had advanced
the approaches within ten paces of the counterscarps of th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>e
hornwork. Lieutenant-General Cadogan received a slight
wound in the neck soon after opening the trenches.</p>

<p>The enemy were throwing up entrenchments between
Quesnoy and Valenciennes, and the Chevalier de Luxemburg
was encamped near Charleroi with a body of
10,000 men. Advices from Catalonia by the way of
Genoa import, that Count Staremberg, having passed the
Segra, advanced towards Balaguier, which place he took
after a few hours' resistance, and made the garrison,
consisting of three Spanish battalions, prisoners of war.
Letters from Berne say, that the army under the command
of Count Thaun had begun to repass the mountains, and
would shortly evacuate Savoy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Whereas Mr. Bickerstaff has received intelligence, that a
young gentleman, who has taken my discourses upon John
Partridge and others in too literal a sense, and is suing
an elder brother to an ejectment; the aforesaid young
gentleman is hereby advised to drop his action, no man
being esteemed dead in law, who eats and drinks, and
receives his rents.</p>

<p class="center">From <i>Tuesday, Oct. 4</i>, to <i>Thursday, Oct. 6, 1709</i>.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 5.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">As bad as the world is, I find by very strict observation
upon virtue and vice, that if men appeared no
worse than they really are, I should have less work than at
present I am obliged to undertake for their reformation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>
<p>They have generally taken up a kind of inverted ambition,
and affect even faults and imperfections of which
they are innocent. The other day in a coffee-house I
stood by a young heir, with a fresh, sanguine, and healthy
look, who entertained us with an account of his claps and
his diet-drink; though, to my knowledge, he is as sound
as any of his tenants. This worthy youth put me into
reflections upon that subject; and I observed the fantastical
humour to be so general, that there is hardly a
man who is not more or less tainted with it. The first of
this order of men are the valetudinarians, who are never
in health, but complain of want of stomach or rest
every day till noon, and then devour all which comes
before them. Lady Dainty<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> is convinced, that it is
necessary for a gentlewoman to be out of order; and to
preserve that character, she dines every day in her closet
at twelve, that she may become her table at two, and
be unable to eat in public. About five years ago, I
remember it was the fashion to be short-sighted: a man
would not own an acquaintance until he had first examined
him with his glass. At a lady's entrance into the
play-house, you might see tubes immediately levelled at
her from every quarter of the pit and side-boxes.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> However,
that mode of infirmity is out, and the age has
recovered its sight; but the blind seem to be succeede<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>d
by the lame, and a jaunty limp is the present beauty.
I think I have formerly observed, a cane is part of the
dress of a prig, and always worn upon a button, for fear
he should be thought to have an occasion for it, or
be esteemed really, and not genteelly, a cripple. I have
considered, but could never find out the bottom of this
vanity. I indeed have heard of a Gascon general, who,
by the lucky grazing of a bullet on the roll of his
stocking, took occasion to halt all his life after. But
as for our peaceable cripples, I know no foundation for
their behaviour, without it may be supposed that in this
warlike age, some think a cane the next honour to a
wooden leg. This sort of affectation I have known run
from one limb or member to another. Before the
limpers came in, I remember a race of lispers, fine persons,
who took an aversion to particular letters in our
language: some never uttered the letter H; and others
had as mortal an aversion for S. Others have had their
fashionable defect in their ears, and would make you
repeat all you said twice over. I know an ancient
friend of mine, whose table is every day surrounded
with flatterers, that makes use of this, sometimes as a
piece of grandeur, and at others as an art, to make
them repeat their commendations. Such affectations
have been indeed in the world in ancient times; but
they fell into them out of politic ends. Alexander the
Great had a wry neck, which made it the fashion in his
court to carry their heads on one side when they came
into the presence. One who thought to outshine the
whole court, carried his head so very complaisantly, that
this martial prince gave him so great a box on the ear as
set all the heads of the court upright.</p>

<p>This humour takes place in our minds as well as
bodies. I know at this time a young gentleman, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
talks atheistically all day in coffee-houses, and in his
degrees of understanding sets up for a free-thinker;
though it can be proved upon him, he says his prayers
every morning and evening. But this class of modern
wits I shall reserve for a chapter by itself. Of the like
turn are all your marriage-haters, who rail at the noose,
at the words, "For ever and aye," and are secretly pining
for some young thing or other that makes their hearts
ache by her refusal. The next to these, are those who
pretend to govern their wives, and boast how ill they
use them; when at the same time, go to their houses,
and you shall see them step as if they feared making a
noise, and are as fond as an alderman. I don't know,
but sometimes these pretences may arise from a desire to
conceal a contrary defect than that they set up for. I
remember, when I was a young fellow, we had a companion
of a very fearful complexion, who, when we sat
in to drink, would desire us to take his sword from
him when he grew fuddled, for it was his misfortune to
be quarrelsome. There are many, many of these evils,
which demand my observation; but because I have of late
been thought somewhat too satirical, I shall give them
warning, and declare to the whole world, that they are not
true, but false hypocrites; and make it out, that they are
good men in their hearts. The motive of this monstrous
affectation in the above-mentioned, and the like particulars,
I take to proceed from that noble thirst of fame and
reputation which is planted in the hearts of all men.
As this produces elegant writings and gallant actions in
men of great abilities, it also brings forth spurious productions
in men who are not capable of distinguishing
themselves by things which are really praiseworthy.
As the desire of fame in men of true wit and gallantry
shows itself in proper instances, the same desire in men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
who have the ambition without proper faculties, runs
wild, and discovers itself in a thousand extravagancies, by
which they would signalise themselves from others, and
gain a set of admirers. When I was a middle-aged man,
there were many societies of ambitious young men in
England, who, in their pursuits after fame, were every
night employed in roasting porters, smoking cobblers,
knocking down watchmen, overturning constables, breaking
windows, blackening sign-posts, and the like immortal
enterprises, that dispersed their reputation throughout
the whole kingdom. One could hardly find a knocker
at a door in a whole street after a midnight expedition of
these <i>beaux esprits</i>. I was lately very much surprised by
an account of my maid, who entered my bedchamber
this morning in a very great fright, and told me, she was
afraid my parlour was haunted; for that she had found
several panes of my windows broken, and the floor
strewed with halfpence.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> I have not yet a full light
into this new way, but am apt to think, that it is a
generous piece of wit that some of my contemporaries
make use of, to break windows, and leave money to
pay for them.</p>


<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, October 5.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have no manner of news, more than what the whole
town had the other day; except that I have the original
letter of the Mareschal Bouffiers to the French King,
after the late battle in the woods, which I translate for
the benefit of the English reader.</p>

<p>Letters have been sent to Mr. Bickerstaff, relating to
the present state of the town of Bath, wherein the
people of that place have desired him to call home the
physicians. All gentlemen therefore of that profession
are hereby directed to return forthwith to their places

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 7.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">As your painters, who deal in history-pieces, often
entertain themselves upon broken sketches, and
smaller flourishes of the pencil; so I find some relief i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>n
striking out miscellaneous hints, and sudden starts of
fancy, without any order or connection, after having
spent myself on more regular and elaborate dissertations.
I am at present in this easy state of mind, sat down to
my scrutoire; where, for the better disposition of my
correspondence, I have writ upon every drawer the proper
title of its contents, as hypocrisy, dice, patches, politics,
love, duels, and so forth. My various advices are
ranged under such several heads, saving only that I have a
particular box for Pacolet, and another for Monoculus.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
I cannot but observe, that my duel-box, which is filled
by the lettered men of honour, is so very ill-spelt, that
it is hard to decipher their writings. My love-box,
though on a quite contrary subject, filled with the works
of the fairest hands in Great Britain, is almost as
unintelligible. The private drawer, which is sacred to
politics, has in it some of the most refined panegyrics
and satires that any age has produced. I have now
before me several recommendations for places at my
table of fame: three of them are of an extraordinary
nature, in which I find I am misunderstood, and shall
therefore beg leave to produce them. They are from a
Quaker, a courtier, and a citizen.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isaac</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Thy lucubrations, as thou lovest to call them, have
been perused by several of our friends, who have
taken offence: forasmuch as thou excludest out of the
brotherhood all persons who are praiseworthy for religion,
we are afraid that thou wilt fill thy table with none but
heathens, and cannot hope to spy a brother there; for
there are none of us who can be placed among murderin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>g
heroes, or ungodly wits; since we do not assail our
enemies with the arm of flesh, nor our gainsayers with
the vanity of human wisdom. If therefore thou wilt
demean thyself on this occasion with a right judgment,
according to the gifts that are in thee, we desire thou
wilt place James Nayler<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> at the upper end of thy table.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Ezekiel Stiffrump.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>In answer to my good friend Ezekiel, I must stand to
it, that I cannot break my rule for the sake of James
Nayler; not knowing, whether Alexander the Great,
who is a choleric hero, won't resent his sitting at the
upper end of the table with his hat on.</p>

<p>But to my courtier:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I am surprised, that you lose your time in complimenting
the dead, when you may make your court
to the living. Let me only tell you in the ear, Alexander
and C&aelig;sar (as generous as they were formerly) have not
now a groat to dispose of. Fill your table with good
company: I know a person of quality that shall give
you &pound;100 for a place at it. Be secret, and be rich.</p>

<p class="center">"Yours,</p>
<p class="right">You know my hand."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gentleman seems to have the true spirit, without
the formality of an under courtier; therefore I shall be
plain with him, and let him leave the name of his courtier,
and &pound;100 in Morphew's hands: if I can take it, I will.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>
<p>My citizen writes the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"Mr. <span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff</span>,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Your <i>Tatler</i> of September 13,<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> am now reading, and
in your list of famous men, desire you not
forget Alderman Whittington, who began the world with
a cat, and died worth three hundred and fifty thousand
pounds sterling, which he left to an only daughter, three
years after his Mayoralty. If you want any further
particulars of ditto Alderman, daughter, or cat, let me
know, and per first will advise the needful. Which
concludes,</p>

<p class="center">"Your loving Friend,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lemuel Ledger.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I shall have all due regard to this gentleman's recommendation;
but cannot forbear observing, how
wonderfully this sort of style is adapted for the despatch
of business, by leaving out insignificant particles: besides
that, the dropping of the first person is an artful way to
disengage a man from the guilt of rash words or promises.
But I am to consider, that a citizen's reputation is credit,
not fame; and am to leave these lofty subjects for a
matter of private concern in the next letter before me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I am just recovered out of a languishing sickness by
the care of Hippocrates,<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> who visited me throughout
my whole illness, and was so far from taking any fee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>,
that he inquired into my circumstances, and would have
relieved me also that way, but I did not want it. I know
no method of thanking him, but recommending it to you
to celebrate so great humanity in the manner you think
fit, and to do it with the spirit and sentiments of a man
just relieved from grief, misery, and pain; to joy, satisfaction,
and ease: in which you will represent the
grateful sense of</p>

<p class="center">"Your obedient Servant,</p>
<p class="right">T. B."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the writer of this letter has put the matter
in as good a dress as I can for him; yet I cannot but add
my applause to what this distressed man has said. There
is not a more useful man in a commonwealth than a
good physician; and by consequence no worthier a
person than he that uses his skill with generosity, even
to persons of condition, and compassion to those who
are in want: which is the behaviour of Hippocrates,
who shows as much liberality in his practice, as he does
wit in his conversation and skill in his profession. A
wealthy doctor, who can help a poor man, and will not
without a fee, has less sense of humanity than a poor
ruffian, who kills a rich man to supply his necessities.
It is something monstrous to consider a man of a liberal
education tearing out the bowels of a poor family, by
taking for a visit what would keep them a week.
Hippocrates needs not the comparison of such extortion
to set off his generosity; but I mention his generosity
to add shame to such extortion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This is to give notice to all ingenious gentlemen in
and about the cities of London and Westminster, who
have a mind to be instructed in the noble sciences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
music, poetry, and politics, that they repair to the
Smyrna Coffee-house<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> in Pall Mall, betwixt the hours
of eight and ten at night, where they may be instructed
gratis, with elaborate essays by word of mouth on all or
any of the above-mentioned arts. The disciples are to
prepare their bodies with three dishes of Bohea, and
purge their brains with two pinches of snuff. If any
young student gives indication of parts, by listening
attentively, or asking a pertinent question, one of the
professors shall distinguish him, by taking snuff out of
his box in the presence of the whole audience.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;The seat of learning is now removed from the
corner of the chimney on the left-hand towards the
window, to the round table in the middle of the floor
over against the fire; a revolution much lamented by
the porters and chairmen, who were much edified through
a pane of glass that remained broken all the last summer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I cannot forbear advertising my correspondents, that
I think myself treated by some of them after too familiar
a manner, and in phrases that neither become them to
give, or me to take. I shall therefore desire for the
future, that if any one returns me an answer to a letter,
he will not tell me he has received the favour of my
letter; but if he does not think fit to say, he has
received the honour of it, that he tell me in plain
English, he has received my letter of such a date. I
must likewise insist, that he would conclude with, "I am
with great respect," or plainly, "I am," without further
addition; and not insult me, by an assurance of his being
with "great truth" and "esteem" my humble servant.
There is likewise another mark of superiority which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>cannot bear, and therefore must inform my correspondents,
that I discard all "faithful" humble servants, and
am resolved to read no letters that are not subscribed,
"Your most obedient," or "most humble Servant,"
or both. These may appear niceties to vulgar minds,
but they are such as men of honour and distinction must
have regard to. And I very well remember a famous
duel in France, where four were killed of one side, and
three of the other, occasioned by a gentleman's subscribing
himself a "most affectionate Friend."</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 10.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">My sister Jenny's lover, the honest Tranquillus (for
that shall be his name), has been impatient with
me to despatch the necessary directions for his marriage;
that while I am taken up with imaginary schemes (as he
called them) he might not burn with real desire, and the
torture of expectation. When I had reprimanded him
for the ardour wherein he expressed himself, which I
thought had not enough of that veneration with which
the marriage-bed is to be ascended, I told him, the day
of his nuptials should be on the Saturday following,
which was the 8th instant. On the 7th in the evening,
poor Jenny came into my chamber, and having her heart
full of the great change of life from a virgin condition
to that of a wife, she long sat silent. I saw she expected
me to entertain her on this important subject, which was
too delicate a circumstance for herself to touch upon;
whereupon I relieved her modesty in the following
manner: "Sister," said I, "you are now going from
me; and be contented, that you leave the company of
a talkative old man, for that of a sober young one: but
take this along with you, that there is no mean in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
state you are entering into, but you are to be exquisitely
happy or miserable, and your fortune in this way of life
will be wholly of your own making. In all the
marriages I have ever seen (most of which have been
unhappy ones), the great cause of evil has proceeded
from slight occasions; and I take it to be the first
maxim in a married condition, that you are to be above
trifles. When two persons have so good an opinion of
each other as to come together for life, they will not
differ in matters of importance, because they think of
each other with respect in regard to all things of consideration
that may affect them, and are prepared for
mutual assistance and relief in such occurrences; but for
less occasions, they have formed no resolutions, but leave
their minds unprepared. This, dear Jenny, is the
reason that the quarrel between Sir Harry Willit and
his lady, which began about her squirrel, is irreconcilable:
Sir Harry was reading a grave author; she runs into his
study, and in a playing humour, claps the squirrel upon
the folio. He threw the animal in a rage on the floor;
she snatches it up again, calls Sir Harry a sour pedant,
without good nature or good manners. This cast him
into such a rage, that he threw down the table before
him, kicked the book round the room; then recollected
himself: 'Lord, Madam,' said he, 'why did you run
into such expressions? I was,' said he, 'in the highest
delight with that author when you clapped your squirrel
upon my book;' and smiling, added upon recollection,
'I have a great respect for your favourite, and pray let
us all be friends.' My lady was so far from accepting
this apology, that she immediately conceived a resolution
to keep him under for ever, and with a serious air replied,
'There is no regard to be had to what a man says, who
can fall into so indecent a rage, and such an abject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
submission, in the same moment, for which I absolutely
despise you.' Upon which she rushed out of the room.
Sir Harry stayed some minutes behind to think and
command himself; after which he followed her into her
bedchamber, where she was prostrate upon the bed,
tearing her hair, and naming twenty coxcombs who
would have used her otherwise. This provoked him to
so high a degree, that he forbore nothing but beating
her; and all the servants in the family were at their
several stations listening, while the best man and woman,
the best master and mistress, defamed each other in a
way that is not to be repeated even at Billingsgate.
You know this ended in an immediate separation: she
longs to return home, but knows not how to do it:
he invites her home every day, and lies with every
woman he can get. Her husband requires no submission
of her; but she thinks her very return will argue she is
to blame, which she is resolved to be for ever, rather than
acknowledge it. Thus, dear Jenny, my great advice to
you is, be guarded against giving or receiving little
provocations. Great matters of offence I have no reason
to fear either from you or your husband." After this,
we turned our discourse into a more gay style, and
parted: but before we did so, I made her resign her
snuff-box<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> for ever, and half drown herself with washing
away the stench of the musty.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> But the wedding
morning arrived, and our family being very numerous,
there was no avoiding the inconvenience of making the
ceremony and festival more public than the modern way
of celebrating them makes me approve of. The bride
next morning came out of her chamber, dressed with all
the art and care that Mrs. Toilet the tire-woman could
bestow on her. She was on her wedding-day three an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>d
twenty: her person is far from what we call a regular
beauty; but a certain sweetness in her countenance, an
ease in her shape and motion, with an unaffected modesty
in her looks, had attractions beyond what symmetry
and exactness can inspire without the addition of these
endowments. When her lover entered the room, her
features flushed with shame and joy; and the ingenuous
manner, so full of passion and of awe, with which
Tranquillus approached to salute her, gave me good
omens of his future behaviour towards her. The
wedding was wholly under my care. After the
ceremony at church, I was resolved to entertain the
company with a dinner suitable to the occasion, and
pitched upon the Apollo,<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> at the Old Devil at
Temple Bar, as a place sacred to mirth, tempered with
discretion, where Ben Jonson and his "sons" used to make
their liberal meetings. Here the chief of the Staffian
race appeared; and as soon as the company were come
into that ample room, Lepidus Wagstaff began to make
me compliments for choosing that place, and fell into a
discourse upon the subject of pleasure and entertainment,
drawn from the rules of Ben's Club,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> which are in gold
letters over the chimney. Lepidus has a way very
uncommon, and speaks on subjects, on which any man
else would certainly offend, with great dexterity. He
gave us a large account of the public meetings of all
the well-turned minds who had passed through this life
in ages past, and closed his pleasing narrative with a
discourse on marriage, and a repetition of the following
verses out of Milton:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Hail wedded love! mysterious law! true source</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>By thee adult'rous lust was driven from men</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Among the bestial herds to range; by thee,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Of father, son, and brother, first were known,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Perpetual fountain of domestic sweets,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Here Love his golden shafts employs; here lights</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>In these verses, all the images that can come into
a young woman's head on such an occasion, are raised;
but that in so chaste and elegant a manner, that the
bride thanked him for his agreeable talk, and we sat
down to dinner. Among the rest of the company, there
was got in a fellow you call a wag. This ingenious
person is the usual life of all feasts and merriments, by
speaking absurdities, and putting everybody of breeding
and modesty out of countenance. As soon as we sat
down, he drank to the bride's diversion that night, and
then made twenty double meanings on the word thing.
We are the best bred family, for one so numerous, in
this kingdom; and indeed we should all of us have been
as much out of countenance as the bride, but that we
were relieved by an honest rough relation of ours at the
lower end of the table, who is a lieutenant of marines.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>
<p>This soldier and sailor had good plain sense, and saw
what was wrong as well as another; he had a way of
looking at his plate, and speaking aloud in an inward
manner; and whenever the wag mentioned the word
"thing," or the words "that same," the lieutenant in that
voice cried, "Knock him down." The merry man
wondering, angry, and looking round, was the diversion
of the table. When he offered to recover, and say, "To
the bride's best thoughts," "Knock him down," says the
lieutenant, and so on. This silly humour diverted, and
saved us from the fulsome entertainment of an ill-bred
coxcomb, and the bride drank the lieutenant's health.
We returned to my lodging, and Tranquillus led his
wife to her apartment, without the ceremony of throwing
the stocking, which generally costs two or three maidenheads
without any ceremony at all.</p>

<h3><i>Grecian Coffee-house, October 12.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">This learned Board has complained to me of the exorbitant
price of late years put upon books, and
consequently on learning, which has raised the reward
demanded by learned men for their advice and labour.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>
<p>In order to regulate and fix a standard in these matters,
divines, physicians, and lawyers have sent in large proposals,
which are of great light and instruction. From
the perusal of these memorials, I am come to this immediate
resolution, till I have leisure to treat the matter at
large, viz., in divinity, Fathers shall be valued according
to their antiquity, schoolmen by the pound weight, and
sermons by their goodness. In my own profession, which
is mostly physic, authors shall be rated according to their
language. The Greek is so rarely understood, and the
English so well, I judge them of no value, so that only
Latin shall bear a price, and that too according to its
purity, and as it serves best for prescription. In law, the
value must be set according to the intricacy and obscurity
of the author, and blackness of the letter; provided
always, that the binding be of calves-skin. This method
I shall settle also with relation to all other writings;
insomuch that even these our lucubrations, though hereafter
printed by Aldus, Elzevir, or Stephanus, shall not
advance above one single penny.</p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, October 12.</i></h3>

<p>It will be allowed me, that I have all along showed
great respect in matters which concern the fair sex; but
the inhumanity with which the author of the following
letter has been used, is not to be suffered.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>October 9.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Yesterday I had the misfortune to drop in at my
Lady Haughty's upon her visiting day. When
I entered the room where she receives company, they all
stood up indeed; but they stood as if they were to stare
at, rather than to receive me. After a long pause, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
servant brought a round stool, on which I sat down at
the lower end of the room, in the presence of no less
than twelve persons, gentlemen and ladies, lolling in
elbow-chairs. And to complete my disgrace, my mistress
was of the society. I tried to compose myself in vain,
not knowing how to dispose of either my legs or arms,
nor how to shape my countenance; the eyes of the whole
room being still upon me in a profound silence. My
confusion at last was so great, that without speaking, or
being spoken to, I fled for it, and left the assembly to
treat me at their discretion. A lecture from you upon
these inhuman distinctions in a free nation, will, I doubt
not, prevent the like evils for the future, and make it,
as we say, as cheap sitting as standing. I am with the
greatest respect,</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>
<p class="center">Your most humble, and<br />
Most obedient Servant,</p>
<p class="right">J. R."</p>

<p>"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I had almost forgot to inform you, that a fair
young lady sat in an armless chair upon my right hand
with manifest discontent in her looks."</p></blockquote>

<p>Soon after the receipt of this epistle, I heard a very
gentle knock at my door: my maid went down, and
brought up word, that a tall, lean, black man, well
dressed, who said he had not the honour to be acquainted
with me, desired to be admitted. I bid her show him
up, met him at my chamber door, and then fell back a
few paces. He approached me with great respect, and
told me with a low voice, he was the gentleman that
had been seated upon the round stool. I immediately
recollected that there was a joint-stool in my chamber,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
which I was afraid he might take for an instrument of
distinction, and therefore winked at my boy to carry it
into my closet. I then took him by the hand, and led
him to the upper end of my room, where I placed him
in my great elbow-chair; at the same time drawing another
without arms to it, for myself to sit by him. I
then asked him, at what time this misfortune befell him?
He answered, between the hours of seven and eight in
the evening. I further demanded of him, what he had
eaten or drunk that day? He replied, nothing but a dish
of water-gruel, with a few plums in it. In the next
place I felt his pulse, which was very low and languishing.
These circumstances confirmed me in an opinion
which I had entertained upon the first reading of his
letter, that the gentleman was far gone in the spleen. I
therefore advised him to rise the next morning and
plunge into the cold bath, there to remain under water
until he was almost drowned. This I ordered him to
repeat six days successively; and on the seventh, to repair
at the wonted hour to my Lady Haughty's, and to
acquaint me afterwards with what he shall meet with
there; and particularly to tell me, whether he shall
think they stared upon him so much as the time before.
The gentleman smiled; and by his way of talking to me,
showed himself a man of excellent sense in all particulars,
unless when a cane chair, a round or a joint stool, were
spoken of. He opened his heart to me at the same time
concerning several other grievances; such as, being overlooked
in public assemblies, having his bows unanswered,
being helped last at table, and placed at the back part of
a coach; with many other distresses, which have withered
his countenance, and worn him to a skeleton. Finding
him a man of reason, I entered into the bottom of his
distemper. "Sir," said I, "there are more of your con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>stitution
in this island of Great Britain than in any other
part of the world; and I beg the favour of you to tell
me, whether you do not observe, that you meet with
most affronts in rainy days." He answered candidly, that
he had long observed, that people were less saucy in sunshine
than in cloudy weather. Upon which I told him
plainly, his distemper was the spleen; and that though
the world was very ill-natured, it was not so bad as he
believed it. I further assured him, that his use of the
cold bath, with a course of steel which I should prescribe
him, would certainly cure most of his acquaintance of
their rudeness, ill-behaviour, and impertinence. My
patient smiled, and promised to observe my prescriptions,
not forgetting to give me an account of their operation.
This distemper being pretty epidemical, I shall, for the
benefit of mankind, give the public an account of the
progress I make in the cure of it.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 12.</i></h3>

<p>The author of the following letter behaves himself
so ingenuously, that I cannot defer answering him any
longer.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Honoured Sir</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>October 6.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have lately contracted a very honest and undissembled
claudication in my left foot, which will be
a double affliction to me, if (according to your <i>Tatler</i> of
this day<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>) it must pass upon the world for a piece of
singularity and affectation. I must therefore humbly beg
leave to limp along the streets after my own way, or I
shall be inevitably ruined in coach-hire. As soon as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>am tolerably recovered, I promise to walk as upright as
a ghost in a tragedy, being not of a stature to spare an
inch of height that I can any way pretend to. I honour
your lucubrations, and am, with the most profound submission,</p>

<p>"Honoured Sir,</p>
<p class="center">Your most dutiful and</p>
<p class="right">Most obedient Servant, &amp;c."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not doubting but the case is as the gentleman represents,
I do hereby order Mr. Morphew to deliver him
out a licence, upon paying his fees, which shall empower
him to wear a cane till the 13th of March next; five
months being the most I can allow for a sprain.</p>


<h3><i>St. James's Coffee-house, October 12.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">We received this morning a mail from Holland, which
brings advice, that the siege of Mons is carried on
with so great vigour and bravery, that we hope very suddenly
to be masters of the place. All things necessary
being prepared for making the assault on the hornwork
and ravelin of the attack of Bertamont, the charge
began with the fire of bombs and grenades, which was so
hot, that the enemy quitted their post, and we lodged
ourselves on those works without opposition. During
this storm, one of our bombs fell into a magazine of the
enemy, and blew it up. There are advices which say,
the court of France had made new offers of peace to the
confederates; but this intelligence wants confirmation.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 14.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There are two kinds of immortality: that which the
soul really enjoys after this life, and that imaginary
existence by which men live in their fame and reputation.
The best and greatest actions have proceeded
from the prospect of the one or the other of these; but my
design is to treat only of those who have chiefly proposed
to themselves the latter as the principal reward of their
labours. It was for this reason that I excluded from my
tables of fame all the great founders and votaries of religion;
and it is for this reason also that I am more than
ordinarily anxious to do justice to the persons of whom
I am now going to speak; for since fame was the only
end of all their enterprises and studies, a man cannot b<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>e
too scrupulous in allotting them their due proportion of
it. It was this consideration which made me call the
whole body of the learned to my assistance; to many of
whom I must own my obligations for the catalogues of
illustrious persons which they have sent me in upon this
occasion. I yesterday employed the whole afternoon in
comparing them with each other; which made so strong
an impression upon my imagination, that they broke my
sleep for the first part of the following night, and at
length threw me into a very agreeable vision, which I
shall beg leave to describe in all its particulars.</p>

<p>I dreamed that I was conveyed into a wide and boundless
plain, that was covered with prodigious multitudes
of people, which no man could number. In the midst
of it there stood a mountain, with its head above the
clouds. The sides were extremely steep, and of such a
particular structure, that no creature, which was not
made in a human figure, could possibly ascend it. On
a sudden there was heard from the top of it a sound like
that of a trumpet; but so exceeding sweet and harmonious,
that it filled the hearts of those who heard it with
raptures, and gave such high and delightful sensations, as
seemed to animate and raise human nature above itself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>This made me very much amazed to find so very few in
that innumerable multitude who had ears fine enough
to hear or relish this music with pleasure: but my wonder
abated, when, upon looking round me, I saw most of
them attentive to three sirens clothed like goddesses, and
distinguished by the names of Sloth, Ignorance, and
Pleasure. They were seated on three rocks, amidst a
beautiful variety of groves, meadows, and rivulets, that
lay on the borders of the mountain. While the base
and grovelling multitude of different nations, ranks, and
ages were listening to these delusive deities, those of a
more erect aspect and exalted spirit separated themselves
from the rest, and marched in great bodies towards the
mountain; from whence they heard the sound, which
still grew sweeter the more they listened to it.</p>

<p>On a sudden, methought this select band sprang
forward with a resolution to climb the ascent, and follow
the call of that heavenly music. Every one took something
with him that he thought might be of assistance
to him in his march. Several had their swords drawn,
some carried rolls of paper in their hands, some had
compasses, others quadrants, others telescopes, and others
pencils; some had laurels on their heads, and others
buskins on their legs: in short, there was scarce any
instrument of a mechanic art or liberal science which
was not made use of on this occasion. My good demon,
who stood at my right hand during the course of this
whole vision, observing in me a burning desire to join
that glorious company, told me, he highly approved that
generous ardour with which I seemed transported; but
at the same time advised me to cover my face with a
mask all the while I was to labour on the ascent. I
took his counsel without inquiring into his reasons.
The whole body now broke into different parties, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
began to climb the precipice by ten thousand different
paths. Several got into little alleys, which did not reach
far up the hill, before they ended and led no farther;
and I observed, that most of the artisans, which considerably
diminished our number, fell into these paths.
We left another considerable body of adventurers behind
us, who thought they had discovered byways up the
hill, which proved so very intricate and perplexed, that
after having advanced in them a little, they were quite
lost among the several turns and windings; and though
they were as active as any in their motions, they made
but little progress in the ascent. These, as my guide
informed me, were men of subtle tempers, and puzzled
politics, who would supply the place of real wisdom with
cunning and artifice. Among those who were far advanced
in their way, there were some that by one false
step fell backward, and lost more ground in a moment
than they had gained for many hours, or could be ever
able to recover. We were now advanced very high, and
observed, that all the different paths which ran about
the sides of the mountain, began to meet in two great
roads, which insensibly gathered the whole multitude
of travellers into two great bodies. At a little distance
from the entrance of each road, there stood a hideous
phantom, that opposed our farther passage. One of
these apparitions had his right hand filled with darts,
which he brandished in the face of all who came up that
way. Crowds ran back at the appearance of it, and cried
out, "Death." The spectre that guarded the other
road was Envy: she was not armed with weapons of
destruction like the former; but by dreadful hissings,
noises of reproach, and a horrid distracted laughter; she
appeared more frightful than Death itself, insomuch that
abundance of our company were discouraged from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
passing any farther, and some appeared ashamed of
having come so far. As for myself, I must confess my
heart shrunk within me at the sight of these ghastly
appearances: but on a sudden, the voice of the trumpet
came more full upon us, so that we felt a new resolution
reviving in us; and in proportion as this resolution grew,
the terrors before us seemed to vanish. Most of the
company who had swords in their hands, marched on
with great spirit, and an air of defiance, up the road that
was commanded by Death; while others, who had
thought and contemplation in their looks, went forward
in a more composed manner up the road possessed by
Envy. The way above these apparitions grew smooth
and uniform, and was so delightful, that the travellers
went on with pleasure, and in a little time arrived at the
top of the mountain. They here began to breathe a
delicious kind of ether, and saw all the fields about
them covered with a kind of purple light, that made
them reflect with satisfaction on their past toils, and
diffused a secret joy through the whole assembly, which
showed itself in every look and feature. In the midst
of these happy fields, there stood a palace of a very
glorious structure: it had four great folding-doors, that
faced the four several quarters of the world. On the
top of it was enthroned the goddess of the mountain,
who smiled upon her votaries, and sounded the silver
trumpet which had called them up, and cheered them in
their passage to her palace. They had now formed
themselves into several divisions, a band of historians
taking their stations at each door, according to the
persons whom they were to introduce.</p>

<p>On a sudden the trumpet, which had hitherto sounded
only a march, or a point of war, now swelled all its
notes into triumph and exultation: the whole fabric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
shook, and the doors flew open. The first who stepped
forward was a beautiful and blooming hero, and, as I
heard by the murmurs round me, Alexander the Great.
He was conducted by a crowd of historians. The
person who immediately walked before him, was
remarkable for an embroidered garment, who not being
well acquainted with the place, was conducting him to
an apartment appointed for the reception of fabulous
heroes. The name of this false guide was Quintus
Curtius. But Arrian and Plutarch, who knew better
the avenues of this palace, conducted him into the great
hall, and placed him at the upper end of the first table.
My good demon, that I might see the whole ceremony,
conveyed me to a corner of this room, where I might
perceive all that passed without being seen myself.
The next who entered was a charming virgin, leading
in a venerable old man that was blind. Under her left
arm she bore a harp, and on her head a garland.
Alexander, who was very well acquainted with Homer,
stood up at his entrance, and placed him on his right
hand. The virgin, who it seems was one of the nine
sisters that attended on the goddess of Fame, smiled
with an ineffable grace at their meeting, and retired.
Julius C&aelig;sar was now coming forward; and though
most of the historians offered their service to introduce
him, he left them at the door, and would have no
conductor but himself. The next who advanced, was
a man of a homely but cheerful aspect, and attended
by persons of greater figure than any that appeared
on this occasion. Plato was on his right hand, and
Xenophon on his left. He bowed to Homer, and sat
down by him. It was expected that Plato would
himself have taken a place next to his master Socrates;
but on a sudden there was heard a great clamour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
disputants at the door, who appeared with Aristotle at
the head of them. That philosopher, with some
rudeness, but great strength of reason, convinced the
whole table, that a title to the fifth place was his due,
and took it accordingly. He had scarce sat down, when
the same beautiful virgin that had introduced Homer
brought in another, who hung back at the entrance, and
would have excused himself, had not his modesty been
overcome by the invitation of all who sat at the table.
His guide and behaviour made me easily conclude it
was Virgil. Cicero next appeared, and took his place.
He had inquired at the door for one Lucceius to
introduce him; but not finding him there, he contented
himself with the attendance of many other writers, who all
(except Sallust) appeared highly pleased with the office.</p>

<p>We waited some time in expectation of the next worthy,
who came in with a great retinue of historians, whose
names I could not learn, most of them being natives of
Carthage. The person thus conducted, who was Hannibal,
seemed much disturbed, and could not forbear
complaining to the Board of the affronts he had met
with among the Roman historians, "who attempted," says
he, "to carry me into the subterraneous apartment; and
perhaps would have done it, had it not been for the impartiality
of this gentleman," pointing to Polybius, "who
was the only person, except my own countrymen, that
was willing to conduct me hither." The Carthaginian took
his seat, and Pompey entered with great dignity in his
own person, and preceded by several historians. Lucan
the poet was at the head of them, who observing Homer
and Virgil at the table, was going to sit down himself,
had not the latter whispered him, that whatever pretence
he might otherwise have had, he forfeited his claim to it,
by coming in as one of the historians. Lucan was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
exasperated with the repulse, that he muttered something
to himself, and was heard to say, that since he could not
have a seat among them himself, he would bring in one
who alone had more merit than their whole assembly:
upon which he went to the door, and brought in Cato of
Utica. That great man approached the company with
such an air, that showed he contemned the honour which
he laid a claim to. Observing the seat opposite to C&aelig;sar
was vacant, he took possession of it, and spoke two or
three smart sentences upon the nature of precedency,
which, according to him, consisted not in place, but in
intrinsic merit; to which he added, that the most virtuous
man, wherever he was seated, was always at the
upper end of the table. Socrates, who had a great spirit
of raillery with his wisdom, could not forbear smiling at
a virtue which took so little pains to make itself agreeable.
Cicero took the occasion to make a long discourse
in praise of Cato, which he uttered with much vehemence.
C&aelig;sar answered him with a great deal of seeming temper:
but as I stood at a great distance from them, I was not
able to hear one word of what they said. But I could
not forbear taking notice, that in all the discourse which
passed at the table, a word or nod from Homer decided
the controversy. After a short pause, Augustus appeared,
looking round him with a serene and affable
countenance upon all the writers of his age, who strove
among themselves which of them should show him the
greatest marks of gratitude and respect. Virgil rose
from the table to meet him; and though he was an
acceptable guest to all, he appeared more such to the
learned than the military worthies. The next man
astonished the whole table with his appearance: he was
slow, solemn, and silent in his behaviour, and wore a
raiment curiously wrought with hieroglyphics. As he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
came into the middle of the room, he threw back the
skirt of it, and discovered a golden thigh. Socrates, at
the sight of it, declared against keeping company with
any who were not made of flesh and blood; and therefore
desired Diogenes the Laertian to lead him to the
apartment allotted for fabulous heroes, and worthies of
dubious existence. At his going out, he told them, that
they did not know whom they dismissed; that he was
now Pythagoras, the first of philosophers, and that formerly
he had been a very brave man at the siege of Troy.
"That may be very true," said Socrates; "but you forget
that you have likewise been a very great harlot in your
time."<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> This exclusion made way for Archimedes, who
came forward with a scheme of mathematical figures in his
hand; among which, I observed a cone and a cylinder.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Seeing this table full, I desired my guide for variety
to lead me to the fabulous apartment, the roof of which
was painted with gorgons, chimeras, and centaurs, with
many other emblematical figures, which I wanted both
time and skill to unriddle. The first table was almost
full. At the upper end sat Hercules, leaning an ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>m
upon his club. On his right hand were Achilles and
Ulysses, and between them &AElig;neas. On his left were
Hector, Theseus, and Jason. The lower end had Orpheus,
&AElig;sop, Phalaris,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and Mus&aelig;us. The ushers seemed
at a loss for a twelfth man, when, methought, to my
great joy and surprise, I heard some at the lower end of
the table mention Isaac Bickerstaff: but those of the
upper end received it with disdain, and said, if they must
have a British worthy, they would have Robin Hood.
While I was transported with the honour that was done
me, and burning with envy against my competitor, I was
awakened by the noise of the cannon which were then
fired for the taking of Mons.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> I should have been very
much troubled at being thrown out of so pleasing a
vision on any other occasion; but thought it an agreeable
change to have my thoughts diverted from the
greatest among the dead and fabulous heroes, to the
most famous among the real and the living.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_225" id="Footnote_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_225"><span class="label">[225]</span></a> In the list which he gave to Tickell, Steele describes this paper
as written by Addison and himself jointly. Hawkesworth claimed for
Swift Nos. 66, 67, 74, and 81, and no doubt the idea of "tables of
fame" (No. 67) was started by him. On October 8, Steele wrote to
Swift: "I wonder you do not write sometimes to me. The town is
in great expectation from Bickerstaff; what passed at the election
for the first table being to be published this day seven-night. I have
not seen Ben Tooke a great while, but long to usher you and yours
into the world." But it seems clear that Swift left his friends to carry
out the execution of the plan. As Nichols points out, Swift afterwards
wrote: "I was told that Brutus, and his ancestor Junius, Socrates,
Epaminondas, Cato the younger, and Sir Thomas More, were perpetually
together: a sextumvirate, to which all the ages of the world
cannot add a seventh." Now there are only <i>two</i> of this sextumvirate
admitted to seats at the first "table of fame" in the <i>Tatler</i>. There
are besides, in this paper, manifest deviations from the plan proposed
in No. 67, and palpable contradictions to it. The "side-table" is
here forgotten; the heroes of "great fame but dubious existence"
are turned into a separate apartment; the number of the company
at the second table is reduced from twenty to twelve; Bickerstaff,
who "had not been dead an hundred years," is mentioned to make
out the dozen; of the third table there is nothing said; and the
subject seems finally discussed in one paper, which was evidently
intended to have made three.</p></div>

the defence of Pythagoras against what is here said of him. As to
his "harlotry," he clearly could not be responsible for the metamorphoses
of his soul after death. His soul continued, it was said, to
shift its habitations; and Dicearchus, almost a whole century after
the death of Socrates, related, that on its third removal, it got into the
body of Alce, a beautiful courtesan. (Aul. Gell., "Noct. Att.," IV. xi.)

his soul animate the body of Aspasia, the mistress of Pericles.</p></div>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 17.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">After the mind has been employed on contemplations
suitable to its greatness, it is unnatural to run into
sudden mirth or levity; but we must let the soul subside
as it rose, by proper degrees. My late considerations o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>f
the ancient heroes impressed a certain gravity upon my
mind, which is much above the little gratification received
from starts of humour and fancy, and threw me into a
pleasing sadness. In this state of thought I have been
looking at the fire, and in a pensive manner reflecting
upon the great misfortunes and calamities incident to
human life; among which, there are none that touch so
sensibly, as those which befall persons who eminently
love, and meet with fatal interruptions of their happiness
when they least expect it. The piety of children
to parents, and the affection of parents to their children,
are the effects of instinct; but the affection between
lovers and friends is founded on reason and choice, which
has always made me think, the sorrows of the latter
much more to be pitied than those of the former. The
contemplation of distresses of this sort softens the mind
of man, and makes the heart better. It extinguishes the
seeds of envy and ill-will towards mankind, corrects the
pride of prosperity, and beats down all that fierceness
and insolence which are apt to get into the minds of the
daring and fortunate. For this reason the wise Athenians,
in their theatrical performances, laid before the eyes of
the people the greatest afflictions which could befall
human life, and insensibly polished their tempers by such
representations. Among the modern, indeed there has
arisen a chimerical method of disposing the fortune of
the persons represented, according to what they call
poetical justice; and letting none be unhappy, but those
who deserve it. In such cases, an intelligent spectator,
if he is concerned, knows he ought not to be so; and
can learn nothing from such a tenderness, but that he is
a weak creature, whose passions cannot follow the dictates
of his understanding. It is very natural, when one
is got into such a way of thinking, to recollect those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
examples of sorrow which have made the strongest impression
upon our imaginations. An instance or two of
such you will give me leave to communicate.</p>

<p>A young gentleman and lady of ancient and honourable
houses in Cornwall had from their childhood entertained
for each other a generous and noble passion, which
had been long opposed by their friends, by reason of the
inequality of their fortunes; but their constancy to each
other, and obedience to those on whom they depended,
wrought so much upon their relations, that these celebrated
lovers were at length joined in marriage. Soon
after their nuptials, the bridegroom was obliged to go
into a foreign country, to take care of a considerable
fortune which was left him by a relation, and came very
opportunely to improve their moderate circumstances.
They received the congratulations of all the country on
this occasion; and I remember it was a common sentence
in every one's mouth, "You see how faithful love is
rewarded."</p>

<p>He took this agreeable voyage, and sent home every
post fresh accounts of his success in his affairs abroad;
but at last (though he designed to return with the next
ship) he lamented in his letters, that business would
detain him some time longer from home, because he
would give himself the pleasure of an unexpected arrival.</p>

<p>The young lady, after the heat of the day, walked
every evening on the seashore, near which she lived,
with a familiar friend, her husband's kinswoman, and
diverted herself with what objects they met there, or
upon discourses of the future methods of life in the
happy change of their circumstances. They stood one
evening on the shore together in a perfect tranquillity,
observing the setting of the sun, the calm face of the
deep, and the silent heaving of the waves, which gently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
rolled towards them, and broke at their feet; when at a
distance her kinswoman saw something float on the waters,
which she fancied was a chest; and with a smile told her,
she saw it first, and if it came ashore full of jewels, she
had a right to it. They both fixed their eyes upon it,
and entertained themselves with the subject of the wreck,
the cousin still asserting her right; but promising, if it
was a prize, to give her a very rich coral for the child of
which she was then big, provided she might be god-mother.
Their mirth soon abated, when they observed upon the
nearer approach, that it was a human body. The young
lady, who had a heart naturally filled with pity and
compassion, made many melancholy reflections on the
occasion. "Who knows," said she, "but this man may
be the only hope and heir of a wealthy house; the
darling of indulgent parents, who are now in impertinent
mirth, and pleasing themselves with the thoughts of
offering him a bride they have got ready for him? Or
may he not be the master of a family that wholly depended
upon his life? There may, for aught we know, be half-a-dozen
fatherless children, and a tender wife, now exposed
to poverty by his death. What pleasure might he
have promised himself in the different welcome he was
to have from her and them? But let us go away, it is a
dreadful sight! The best office we can do, is to take
care that the poor man, whoever he is, may be decently
buried." She turned away, when a wave threw the carcass
on the shore. The kinswoman immediately shrieked out,
"Oh, my cousin!" and fell upon the ground. The
unhappy wife went to help her friend, when she saw her
own husband at her feet, and dropped in a swoon upon
the body. An old woman, who had been the gentleman's
nurse, came out about this time to call the ladies in to
supper, and found her child (as she always called him)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
dead on the shore, her mistress and kinswoman both
lying dead by him. Her loud lamentations, and calling
her young master to life, soon awaked the friend from
her trance; but the wife was gone for ever.</p>

<p>When the family and neighbourhood got together
round the bodies, no one asked any question, but the
objects before them told the story.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>Incidents of this nature are the more moving when
they are drawn by persons concerned in the catastrophe,
notwithstanding they are often oppressed beyond the
power of giving them in a distinct light, except we gather
their sorrow from their inability to speak it. I have two
original letters written both on the same day, which are to
me exquisite in their different kinds. The occasion was
this: a young gentleman who had courted a most agreeable
young woman, and won her heart, obtained also the
consent of her father, to whom she was an only child.
The old man had a fancy that they should be married in
the same church where he himself was, in a village in
Westmorland, and made them set out while he was laid
up with the gout at London. The bridegroom took
only his man, the bride her maid. They had the most
agreeable journey imaginable to the place of marriage:
from whence the bridegroom wrote the following letter
to his wife's father:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>March 18, 1672.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"After a very pleasant journey hither, we are preparing
for the happy hour in which I am to be your son.
I assure you the bride carries it, in the eye of the vica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>r
who married you, much beyond her mother; though he
says, your open sleeves, pantaloons, and shoulder-knot
made a much better show than the finical dress I am in.
However, I am contented to be the second fine man this
village ever saw, and shall make it very merry before
night, because I shall write myself from thence,</p>

<p class="center">"Your most dutiful Son,</p>
<p class="right">T. D."</p>

<p>"The bride gives her duty, and is as handsome as
an angel&mdash;I am the happiest man breathing."</p></blockquote>

<p>The villagers were assembling about the church, and
the happy couple took a walk in a private garden. The
bridegroom's man knew his master would leave the place
on a sudden after the wedding, and seeing him draw his
pistols the night before, took this opportunity to go into
his chamber and charge them. Upon their return from
the garden, they went into that room; and after a little
fond raillery on the subject of their courtship, the lover
took up a pistol which he knew he had unloaded the
night before, and presenting it to her, said with the most
graceful air, whilst she looked pleased at his agreeable
flattery, "Now, madam, repent of all those cruelties you
have been guilty of to me; consider before you die, how
often you have made a poor wretch freeze under your
casement;<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> you shall die, you tyrant, you shall die, with
all those instruments of death and destruction about you,
with that enchanting smile, those killing ringlets of your
hair"&mdash;"Give fire," said she, laughing. He did so, and
shot her dead. Who can speak his condition? But h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>e
bore it so patiently as to call up his man. The poor
wretch entered, and his master locked the door upon him.
"Well," said he, "did you charge these pistols?" He
answered, "Yes." Upon which he shot him dead with
that remaining. After this, amidst a thousand broken
sobs, piercing groans, and distracted motions, he wrote
the following letter to the father of his dead mistress:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I, who two hours ago told you truly I was the happiest
man alive, am now the most miserable. Your
daughter lies dead at my feet, killed by my hand, through
a mistake of my man's charging my pistols unknown to
me. Him I have murdered for it. Such is my wedding-day,&mdash;I
will immediately follow my wife to her grave:
but before I throw myself upon my sword, I command
my distraction so far as to explain my story to you. I
fear my heart will not keep together till I have stabbed
it. Poor good old man!&mdash;Remember, he that killed
your daughter, died for it. In the article of death I
give you my thanks, and pray for you, though I dare not
for myself. If it be possible, do not curse me."</p></blockquote>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 19.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is my frequent practice to visit places of resort in
this town where I am least known, to observe what
reception my works meet with in the world, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
good effects I may promise myself from my labours;
and it being a privilege asserted by Monsieur Montaigne
and others, of vainglorious memory, that we writers of
essays may talk of ourselves,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> I take the liberty to give
an account of the remarks which I find are made by
some of my gentle readers upon these my dissertations.
I happened this evening to fall into a coffee-house near
the 'Change, where two persons were reading my account
of the table of fame.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The one of these was commenting
as he read, and explaining who was meant by this
and the other worthy as he passed on. I observed the
person over against him wonderfully intent and satisfied
with his explanation. When he came to Julius C&aelig;sar,
who is said to have refused any conductor to the table,
"No, no," said he, "he is in the right of it, he has
money enough to be welcome wherever he comes;" and
then whispered, "He means a certain colonel of the
train-bands." Upon reading, that Aristotle made his
claim with some rudeness, but great strength of reason,
"Who can that be, so rough and so reasonable? It
must be some Whig I warrant you. There is nothing
but party in these public papers." Where Pythagoras is
said to have a golden thigh, "Ay, ay," said he, "he has
money enough in his breeches, that is the alderman of
our ward." You must know, whatever he read, I found
he interpreted from his own way of life and acquaintance.
I am glad my readers can construe for themselves thes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>e
difficult points; but for the benefit of posterity, I design,
when I come to write my last paper of this kind, to
make it an explanation of all my former. In that piece
you shall have all I have commended, with their proper
names. The faulty characters must be left as they are,
because we live in an age wherein vice is very general,
and virtue very particular; for which reason the latter
only wants explanation. But I must turn my present
discourse to what is of yet greater regard to me than the
care of my writings; that is to say, the preservation of a
lady's heart. Little did I think I should ever have business
of this kind on my hands more; but as little as any
one who knows me would believe it, there is a lady at
this time who professes love to me. Her passion and
good-humour you shall have in her own words.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I had formerly a very good opinion of myself; but
it is now withdrawn, and I have placed it upon you,
Mr. Bickerstaff, for whom I am not ashamed to declare,
I have a very great passion and tenderness. It is not for
your face, for that I never saw; your shape and height I
am equally a stranger to: but your understanding charms
me, and I'm lost if you don't dissemble a little love for
me. I am not without hopes, because I am not like the
tawdry gay things that are fit only to make bone-lace.
I am neither childish-young, nor beldam-old, but (the
world says) a good agreeable woman.</p>

<p>"Speak peace to a troubled heart, troubled only for
you; and in your next paper let me find your thoughts
of me.</p>

<p>"Don't think of finding out who I am, for notwithstanding
your interest in demons, they cannot help you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
either to my name, or a sight of my face; therefore
don't let them deceive you.</p>

<p>"I can bear no discourse if you are not the subject;
and, believe me, I know more of love than you do of
astronomy.</p>

<p>"Pray say some civil things in return to my generosity,
and you shall have my very best pen employed to
thank you, and I will confirm it. I am</p>

<p class="center">"Your Admirer,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Maria.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is something wonderfully pleasing in the favour
of women; and this letter has put me in so good a
humour, that nothing could displease me since I received
it. My boy breaks glasses and pipes, and instead of
giving him a knock of the pate, as my way is (for I hate
scolding at servants), I only say, "Ah! Jack, thou hast a
head, and so has a pin;" or some such merry expression.
But alas! how am I mortified when he is putting on my
fourth pair of stockings on these poor spindles of mine?
The fair one understands love better than I astronomy!
I am sure, without the help of that art, this poor meagre
trunk of mine is a very ill habitation for love. She is
pleased to speak civilly of my sense; but <i>ingenium male
habitat</i> is an invincible difficulty in cases of this nature.
I had always indeed, from a passion to please the eyes of
the fair, a great pleasure in dress. Add to this, that I
have written songs since I was sixty, and have lived with
all the circumspection of an old beau, as I am: but my
friend Horace has very well said, "Every year takes
something from us;"<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and instructed me to form my
pursuits and desires according to the stage of my life:
therefore I have no more to value myself upon, than that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>I can converse with young people without peevishness, or
wishing myself a moment younger. For which reason,
when I am amongst them, I rather moderate than interrupt
their diversions. But though I have this complacency,
I must not pretend to write to a lady civil things,
as Maria desires. Time was, when I could have told her,
I had received a letter from her fair hands; and, that if
this paper trembled as she read it, it then best expressed
its author, or some other gay conceit. Though I never
saw her, I could have told her, that good sense and good
humour smiled in her eyes; that constancy and good
nature dwelt in her heart; that beauty and good breeding
appeared in all her actions. When I was five-and-twenty,
upon sight of one syllable, even wrong spelt, by a lady I
never saw, I could tell her, that her height was that which
was fit for inviting our approach, and commanding our
respect; that a smile sat on her lips, which prefaced her
expressions before she uttered them, and her aspect prevented
her speech. All she could say, though she had
an infinite deal of wit, was but a repetition of what was
expressed by her form; her form! which struck her
beholders with ideas more moving and forcible than ever
were inspired by music, painting, or eloquence. At this
rate I panted in those days; but, ah! sixty-three! I am
very sorry I can only return the agreeable Maria a passion,
expressed rather from the head than the heart.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"You have already seen the best of me, and I so passionately
love you, that I desire we may never
meet. If you will examine your heart, you will find,
that you join the man with the philosopher: and if you
have that kind opinion of my sense as you pretend, I
question not, but you add to it complexion, air, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
shape: but, dear Molly, a man in his grand climacteric
is of no sex. Be a good girl; and conduct yourself with
honour and virtue, when you love one younger than
myself. I am, with the greatest tenderness,</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, October 19.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There is nothing more common than the weakness
mentioned in the following epistle; and I believe
there is hardly a man living who has not been more or
less injured by it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>Land's End, Oct. 12.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have left the town some time; and much the sooner,
for not having had the advantage when I lived there
of so good a pilot as you are to this present age. Your
cautions to the young men against the vices of the town
are very well: but there is one not less needful, which I
think you have omitted. I had from the 'Rough
Diamond' (a gentleman so called from an honest blunt
wit he had) not long since dead, this observation, that a
young man must be at least three or four years in London
before he dares say 'No.'</p>

<p>"You will easily see the truth and force of this observation;
for I believe, more people are drawn away against
their inclinations, than with them. A young man is
afraid to deny anybody going to a tavern to dinner; or
after being gorged there, to repeat the same with another
company at supper, or to drink excessively if desired, or
go to any other place, or commit any other extravagancy
proposed. The fear of being thought covetous, or to
have no money, or to be under the dominion or fear of
his parents and friends, hinders him from the free exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
of his understanding, and affirming boldly the true reason,
which is, his real dislike of what is desired. If you could
cure this slavish facility, it would save abundance at their
first entrance into the world. I am, <span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="center">"Yours,</p>
<p class="right"><i>Solomon Afterwit</i>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This epistle has given an occasion to a treatise on this
subject, wherein I shall lay down rules when a young
stripling is to say "No," and a young virgin "Yes."</p>

<p><i>N.B.</i>&mdash;For the publication of this discourse, I wait
only for subscriptions from the undergraduates of each
University, and the young ladies in the boarding-schools
of Hackney and Chelsea.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 21.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have received a letter subscribed A. B.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> wherein it
has been represented to me as an enormity, that there
are more than ordinary crowds of women at the Old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>Bailey when a rape is to be tried: but by Mr. A. B.'s
favour, I can't tell who are so much concerned in that
part of the law as the sex he mentions, they being the
only persons liable to such insults. Nor indeed do I
think it more unreasonable that they should be
inquisitive on such occasions, than men of honour when
one is tried for killing another in a duel. It is very
natural to inquire how the fatal pass was made, that
we may the better defend ourselves when we come to
be attacked. Several eminent ladies appeared lately at
the Court of Justice on such an occasion, and with great
patience and attention stayed the whole trials of two
persons for the above-said crime. The law to me indeed
seems a little defective on this point; and it is a very
great hardship, that this crime, which is committed by
men only, should have men only on their jury. I
humbly therefore propose, that on future trials of this
sort, half of the twelve may be women; and those such
whose faces are well known to have taken notes, or may
be supposed to remember what happened in former
trials in the same place. There is the learned Androgyne,
that would make a good fore-woman of the panel, who
(by long attendance) understands as much law and
anatomy as is necessary in this case. Till this is taken
care of, I am humbly of opinion, it would be much
more expedient that the fair were wholly absent: for
to what end can it be that they should be present at
such examinations, when they can only be perplexed with
a fellow-feeling for the injured, without any power to
avenge their sufferings. It is an unnecessary pain which
the fair ones give themselves on these occasions. I have
known a young woman shriek out at some parts of the
evidence; and have frequently observed, that when the
proof grew particular and strong, there has been such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
universal flutter of fans, that one would think the whole
female audience were falling into fits. Nor indeed can
I see how men themselves can be wholly unmoved at
such tragical relations. In short, I must tell my female
readers, and they may take an old man's word for it, that
there is nothing in woman so graceful and becoming as
modesty: it adds charms to their beauty, and gives a
new softness to their sex. Without it, simplicity and
innocence appear rude, reading and good sense masculine,
wit and humour lascivious. This is so necessary a
qualification for pleasing, that the loose part of womankind,
whose study it is to ensnare men's hearts, never
fail to support the appearance of what they know is
so essential to that end: and I have heard it reported
by the young fellows in my time, as a maxim of
the celebrated Madam Bennet,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> that a young wench,
though never so beautiful, was not worth her board
when she was past her blushing. This discourse naturally
brings into my thoughts a letter I have received
from the virtuous Lady Whittlestick on the subject of
Lucretia.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>From my Tea-table,<br />
October</i> 17.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Cousin Isaac</span>,
</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I read your <i>Tatler</i> of Saturday last,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> and was surprised
to see you so partial to your own sex, as to think
none of ours worthy to sit at your first table; for sure
you cannot but own Lucretia as famous as any you have
placed there, who first parted with her virtue, and afterwards
with her life, to preserve her fame."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Biddy Twig has written me a letter to the same
purpose: but in answer to both my pretty correspondents
and kinswomen, I must tell them, that although I know
Lucretia would have made a very graceful figure at the
upper end of the table, I did not think it proper to place
her there, because I knew she would not care for being
in the company of so many men without her husband.
At the same time I must own, that Tarquin himself was
not a greater lover and admirer of Lucretia than I
myself am in an honest way. When my sister Jenny
was in her sampler, I made her get the whole story
without book, and tell it me in needlework. This
illustrious lady stands up in history as the glory of her
own sex, and the reproach of ours; and the circumstances
under which she fell were so very particular, that they
seem to make adultery and murder meritorious. She
was a woman of such transcendent virtue, that her
beauty, which was the greatest of the age and country
in which she lived, and is generally celebrated as the
highest of praise in other women, is never mentioned
as a part of her character. But it would be declaiming
to dwell upon so celebrated a story, which I mentioned
only in respect to my kinswomen; and to make
reparation for the omission they complain of, do
further promise them, that if they can furnish me with
instances to fill it, there shall be a small tea-table set
apart in my palace of fame for the reception of all of
her character.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<h3><i>Grecian Coffee-house, October 21.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was this evening communicating my design of producing
obscure merit into public view; and proposed
to the learned, that they would please to assist me in the
work. For the same end I publish my intention to the
world, that all men of liberal thoughts may know they
have an opportunity of doing justice to such worthy
persons as have come within their respective observation,
and who by misfortune, modesty, or want of proper
writers to recommend them, have escaped the notice of
the rest of mankind. If therefore any one can bring any
tale or tidings of illustrious persons, or glorious actions,
that are not commonly known, he is desired to send an
account thereof to me at J. Morphew's, and they shall
have justice done them. At the same time that I have
this concern for men and things that deserve reputation
and have it not, I am resolved to examine into the claims
of such ancients and moderns as are in possession of it,
with a design to displace them, in case I find their titles
defective. The first whose merits I shall inquire into,
are some merry gentlemen of the French nation, who
have written very advantageous histories of their exploits
in war, love, and politics, under the title of memoirs. I
am afraid I shall find several of these gentlemen tardy,
because I hear of them in no writings but their own.
To read the narrative of one of these authors, you would
fancy there was not an action in a whole campaign which
he did not contrive or execute; yet if you consult the
history, or gazettes of those times, you do not find him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>so much as the head of a party from one end of the
summer to the other. But it is the way of these great
men, when they lie behind their lines, and are in a time
of inaction, as they call it, to pass away their time in
writing their exploits. By this means, several who are
either unknown or despised in the present age, will be
famous in the next, unless a sudden stop be put to such
pernicious practices. There are others of that gay people
who (as I am informed) will live half a year together in
a garret, and write a history of their intrigues in the
court of France. As for politicians, they do not abound
with that species of men so much as we; but as ours are
not so famous for writing as for extemporary dissertations
in coffee-houses, they are more annoyed with
memoirs of this nature also than we are. The most
immediate remedy that I can apply to prevent this growing
evil, is, that I do hereby give notice to all booksellers and
translators whatsoever, that the word "memoir" is French
for a novel; and to require of them, that they sell and
translate it accordingly.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, October 21.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Coming into this place to-night, I met an old friend
of mine,<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> who, a little after the Restoration, wrote
an epigram with some applause, which he has lived upon
ever since; and by virtue of it, has been a constant frequenter
of this coffee-house for forty years. He took
me aside, and with a great deal of friendship told me, he
was glad to see me alive; "for" says he, "Mr. Bickerstaff,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>I am sorry to find you have raised many enemies by your
lucubrations. There are indeed some," says he, "whose
enmity is the greatest honour they can show a man; but
have you lived to these years, and don't know, that the
ready way to disoblige is to give advice? You may endeavour
to guard your children, as you call them, but&mdash;"
He was going on; but I found the disagreeableness of
giving advice without being asked it, by my own impatience
of what he was about to say. In a word, I
begged him to give me the hearing of a short fable.</p>

<p>"A gentleman," says I, "who was one day slumbering
in an arbour, was on a sudden awakened by the gentle
biting of a lizard, a little animal remarkable for its love
to mankind. He threw it from his hand with some
indignation, and was rising up to kill it, when he saw an
huge venomous serpent sliding towards him on the other
side, which he soon destroyed; reflecting afterwards with
gratitude upon his friend that saved him, and with anger
against himself, that had shown so little sense of a good
office."</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 24.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">My brother Tranquillus,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> who is a man of business,
came to me this morning into my study, and after
very many civil expressions in return for what good
offices I had done him, told me, he desired to carry his
wife, my sister, that very morning to his own house. I
readily told him I would wait upon him, without askin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>g
why he was so impatient to rob us of his good company.
He went out of my chamber, and I thought seemed to
have a little heaviness upon him, which gave me some
disquiet. Soon after, my sister came to me with a
very matron-like air, and most sedate satisfaction in her
looks, which spoke her very much at ease; but the traces
of her countenance seemed to discover that she had been
lately in passion, and that air of content to flow from a
certain triumph upon some advantage obtained. She no
sooner sat down by me, but I perceived she was one of
those ladies who begin to be managers within the time of
their being brides. Without letting her speak (which I
saw she had a mighty inclination to do), I said, "Here
has been your husband, who tells me he has a mind to
go home this very morning; and I have consented to
it." "It is well," said she, "for you must know&mdash;"
"Nay, Jenny," said I, "I beg your pardon, for it is you
must know&mdash;you are to understand, that now is the time
to fix or alienate your husband's heart for ever; and I
fear you have been a little indiscreet in your expressions
or behaviour towards him even here in my house."
"There has," says she, "been some words; but I'll be
judged by you if he was not in the wrong: nay, I need
not be judged by anybody, for he gave it up himself, and
said not a word, when he saw me grow passionate, but
'Madam, you are perfectly in the right of it.' As you
shall judge&mdash;" "Nay, madam," said I, "I am judge
already, and tell you, that you are perfectly in the wrong
of it; for if it was a matter of importance, I know he
has better sense than you; if a trifle, you know what I
told you on your wedding-day, that you were to be
above little provocations." She knows very well I can
be sour upon occasion, therefore gave me leave to go
on. "Sister," said I, "I will not enter into the dispute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
between you, which I find his prudence put an end to
before it came to extremity, but charge you to have a
care of the first quarrel, as you tender your happiness;
for then it is that the mind will reflect harshly upon
every circumstance that has ever passed between you. If
such an accident is ever to happen (which I hope never
will), be sure to keep to the circumstance before you;
make no allusions to what is past, or conclusions
referring to what is to come: don't show an hoard of matter
for dissension in your breast; but if it is necessary, lay
before him the thing as you understand it, candidly,
without being ashamed of acknowledging an error, or
proud of being in the right. If a young couple be not
careful in this point, they will get into a habit of wrangling:
and when to displease is thought of no consequence,
to please is always of as little moment. There is a play,
Jenny, I have formerly been at when I was a student:
we got into a dark corner with a porringer of brandy,
and threw raisins into it, then set it on fire. My
chamber-fellow and I diverted ourselves with the sport of
venturing our fingers for the raisins; and the wantonness of
the thing was, to see each other look like a demon as we
burnt ourselves and snatched out the fruit. This fantastical
mirth was called snap-dragon. You may go into
many a family, where you see the man and wife at this
sport: every word at their table alludes to some passage
between themselves; and you see by the paleness and
emotion in their countenances, that it is for your sake,
and not their own, that they forbear playing out the
whole game, in burning each other's fingers. In this
case, the whole purpose of life is inverted, and the
ambition turns upon a certain contention, who shall contradict
best, and not upon an inclination to excel in kindnesses
and good offices. Therefore, dear Jenny, remember me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
and avoid snap-dragon." "I thank you, brother," said
she, "but you don't know how he loves me; I find I
can do anything with him." "If you can so, why should
you desire to do anything but please him? But I have
a word or two more before you go out of the room; for
I see you do not like the subject I am upon. Let nothing
provoke you to fall upon an imperfection he cannot
help; for if he has a resenting spirit, he will think your
aversion as immovable as the imperfection with which
you upbraid him. But above all, dear Jenny, be careful
of one thing, and you will be something more than
woman, that is, a levity you are almost all guilty of,
which is, to take a pleasure in your power to give pain.
It is even in a mistress an argument of meanness of spirit,
but in a wife it is injustice and ingratitude. When a
sensible man once observes this in a woman, he must
have a very great or a very little spirit to overlook it.
A woman ought therefore to consider very often, how
few men there are who will regard a meditated offence as
a weakness of temper." I was going on in my confabulation,
when Tranquillus entered. She cast her eyes
upon him with much shame and confusion, mixed with
great complacency and love, and went up to him. He
took her in his arms, and looked so many soft things at
one glance, that I could see he was glad I had been talking
to her, sorry she had been troubled, and angry at
himself that he could not disguise the concern he was in
an hour before. After which, he says to me, with an air
awkward enough, but methought not unbecoming, "I
have altered my mind, brother; we'll live upon you a
day or two longer." I replied, "That's what I have
been persuading Jenny to ask of you; but she is resolved
never to contradict your inclination, and refused me."
We were going on in that way which one hardly knows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
how to express; as when two people mean the same
thing in a nice case, but come at it by talking as distantly
from it as they can; when very opportunely came in
upon us an honest inconsiderable fellow, Tim Dapper, a
gentleman well known to us both. Tim is one of those
who are very necessary by being very inconsiderable.
Tim dropped in at an incident when we knew not how
to fall into either a grave or a merry way. My sister
took this occasion to make off, and Dapper gave us an
account of all the company he had been in to-day, who
was and who was not at home, where he visited. This
Tim is the head of a species: he is a little out of his
element in this town; but he is a relation of Tranquillus,
and his neighbour in the country, which is the true place
of residence for this species. The habit of a Dapper,
when he is at home, is a light broadcloth, with calamanco<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
or red waistcoat and breeches; and it is remarkable,
that their wigs seldom hide the collar of their coats.
They have always a peculiar spring in their arms, a
wriggle in their bodies, and a trip in their gait; all
which motions they express at once in their drinking,
bowing, or saluting ladies; for a distant imitation of a
forward fop, and a resolution to overtop him in his way,
are the distinguishing marks of a Dapper. These under-characters
of men are parts of the sociable world by no
means to be neglected: they are like pegs in a building.
They make no figure in it, but hold the structure together,
and are as absolutely necessary as the pillars and
columns. I am sure we found it so this morning; for
Tranquillus and I should perhaps have looked cold a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>t
each other the whole day, but Dapper fell in with his
brisk way, shook us both by the hand, rallied the bride,
mistook the acceptance he met with amongst us for
extraordinary perfection in himself, and heartily pleased,
and was pleased, all the while he stayed. His company
left us all in good-humour, and we were not such fools
as to let it sink, before we confirmed it by great cheerfulness
and openness in our carriage the whole evening.</p>

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, October 24.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have been this evening to visit a lady who is a
relation of the enamoured Cynthio,<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and there heard
the melancholy news of his death. I was in hopes that
fox-hunting and October would have recovered him
from his unhappy passion. He went into the country
with a design to leave behind him all thoughts of
Clarissa; but he found that place only more convenient
to think of her without interruption. The country
gentlemen were very much puzzled upon his case, and
never finding him merry or loud in their company, took
him for a Roman Catholic, and immediately upon his
death seized his French valet-de-chambre for a priest;
and it is generally thought in the county, it will go hard
with him next session. Poor Cynthio never held up his
head after having received a letter of Clarissa's marriage.
The lady who gave me this account being far gone in
poetry and romance, told me, if I would give her a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>n
epitaph, she would take care to have it placed on his
tomb; which she herself had devised in the following
manner: it is to be made of black marble, and every
corner to be crowned with weeping cupids. Their
quivers are to be hung up upon two tall cypress-trees
which are to grow on each side of the monument, and
their arrows to be laid in a great heap, after the manner
of a funeral pile, on which is to lie the body of the
deceased. On the top of each cypress is to stand the
figure of a moaning turtle-dove. On the uppermost
part of the monument, the goddess to whom these birds
are sacred, is to sit in a dejected posture, as weeping for
the death of her votary. I need not tell you this lady's
head is a little turned: however, to be rid of importunities,
I promised her an epitaph, and told her, I
would take for my pattern that of Don Alonzo, who
was no less famous in his age than Cynthio is in ours.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 26.</i><a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">When I came home last night, my servant delivered
me the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>October 24.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have orders from Sir Harry Quicksett, of Staffordshire,
Bart., to acquaint you, that his honour Sir
Harry himself, Sir Giles Wheelbarrow, Kt.; Thomas
Rentfree, Esq., Justice of the Quorum; Andrew
Windmill, Esq.; and Mr. Nicholas Doubt of the
Inner Temple, Sir Harry's grandson, will wait upon
you at the hour of nine to-morrow morning, being
Tuesday the 25th of October, upon business which
Sir Harry will impart to you by word of mouth. I
thought it proper to acquaint you beforehand so many
persons of quality came, that you might not be surprised
therewith. Which concludes, though by many years'
absence since I saw you at Stafford, unknown,</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>
<p class="center">Your most humble Servant,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Thrifty.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I received this message with less surprise than I
believe Mr. Thrifty imagined; for I knew the goo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>d
company too well to feel any palpitations at their
approach: but I was in very great concern how I should
adjust the ceremonial, and demean myself to all these
great men, who perhaps had not seen anything above
themselves for these twenty years last past. I am sure
that's the case of Sir Harry. Besides which, I was sensible
that there was a great point in adjusting my behaviour
to the simple squire, so as to give him satisfaction, and
not disoblige the Justice of the Quorum. The hour of
nine was come this morning, and I had no sooner set
chairs (by the steward's letter), and fixed my tea-equipage,
but I heard a knock at my door, which was opened, but
no one entered; after which followed a long silence,
which was broke at last by, "Sir, I beg your pardon; I
think I know better:" and another voice, "Nay, good
Sir Giles&mdash;&mdash;" I looked out from my window, and
saw the good company all with their hats off, and arms
spread, offering the door to each other. After many
offers, they entered with much solemnity, in the order
Mr. Thrifty was so kind as to name them to me. But
they are now got to my chamber door, and I saw my
old friend Sir Harry enter. I met him with all the
respect due to so reverend a vegetable; for you are to
know, that is my sense of a person who remains idle in
the same place for half a century. I got him with great
success into his chair by the fire, without throwing down
any of my cups. The knight-bachelor told me, he had
a great respect for my whole family, and would, with my
leave, place himself next to Sir Harry, at whose right
hand he had sat at every Quarter Sessions this thirty
years, unless he was sick. The steward in the rear
whispered the young Templar, "That's true to my
knowledge." I had the misfortune, as they stood cheek
by jowl, to desire the simple squire to sit down before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
the Justice of the Quorum, to the no small satisfaction
of the former, and resentment of the latter. But I saw
my error too late, and got them as soon as I could into
their seats. "Well," said I, "gentlemen, after I have
told you how glad I am of this great honour, I am to
desire you to drink a dish of tea." They answered
one and all, that they never drank tea in a morning.
"Not in a morning!" said I, staring round me. Upon
which the pert jackanapes Nick Doubt tipped me the
wink, and put out his tongue at his grandfather. Here
followed a profound silence, when the steward, in his
boots and whip, proposed, that we should adjourn to
some public-house, where everybody might call for what
they pleased, and enter upon the business. We all
stood up in an instant, and Sir Harry filed off from the
left very discreetly, countermarching behind the chairs
towards the door: after him, Sir Giles in the same
manner. The simple squire made a sudden start to
follow; but the Justice of the Quorum whipped between
upon the stand of the stairs. A maid going up with
coals made us halt, and put us into such confusion,
that we stood all in a heap, without any visible possibility
of recovering our order; for the young jackanapes
seemed to make a jest of this matter, and had so contrived,
by pressing amongst us under pretence of making
way, that his grandfather was got into the middle, and
he knew nobody was of quality to stir a step till Sir
Harry moved first. We were fixed in this perplexity
for some time, till we heard a very loud noise in the
street; and Sir Harry asking what it was, I, to make
them move, said it was fire. Upon this, all ran down
as fast as they could, without order or ceremony, till we
got into the street, where we drew up in very good
order, and filed off down Sheer Lane, the impertinent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Templar driving us before him, as in a string, and
pointing to his acquaintance who passed by. I must
confess I love to use people according to their own
sense of good-breeding, and therefore whipped in
between the Justice and the simple squire. He could
not properly take this ill; but I overheard him whisper
the steward, that he thought it hard that a common
conjuror should take place of him, though an elder
squire. In this order we marched down Sheer Lane, at
the upper end of which I lodge.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> When we came to
Temple Bar, Sir Harry and Sir Giles got over; but a
run of the coaches kept the rest of us on this side
the street: however, we all at last landed, and drew up
in very good order before Ben Tooke's<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> shop, who
favoured our rallying with great humanity. From
hence we proceeded again, till we came to Dick's Coffee-house,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
where I designed to carry them. Here we were
at our old difficulty, and took up the street upon the
same ceremony. We proceeded through the entry, and
were so necessarily kept in order by the situation, that
we were now got into the coffee-house itself, where, as
soon as we arrived, we repeated our civilities to each
other; after which, we marched up to the high table,
which has an ascent to it enclosed in the middle of the
room. The whole room was alarmed at this entry,
made up of persons of so much state and rusticity. Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>Harry called for a mug of ale, and Dyer's Letter.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> The
boy brought the ale in an instant; but said, they did not
take in the Letter. "No!" says Sir Harry: "then
take back your mug; we are like indeed to have good
liquor at this house." Here the Templar tipped me a
second wink, and if I had not looked very grave upon
him, I found he was disposed to be very familiar with
me. In short, I observed after a long pause, that the
gentlemen did not care to enter upon business till after
their morning draught, for which reason I called for a
bottle of mum<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>; and finding that had no effect upon
them, I ordered a second, and a third: after which, Sir
Harry reached over to me, and told me in a low voice,
that the place was too public for business; but he would
call upon me again to-morrow morning at my own
lodgings, and bring some more friends with him.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, October 26.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Though this place is frequented by a more mixed
company than it used to be formerly, yet you
meet very often some whom one cannot leave without
being the better for their conversation. A gentleman
this evening, in a dictating manner, talked I thought
very pleasingly in praise of modesty, in the midst of
ten or twelve libertines, upon whom it seemed to have
had a good effect. He represented it as the certain
indication of a great and noble spirit. "Modesty," said
he, "is the virtue which makes men prefer the public to
their private interest, the guide of every honest undertaking,
and the great guardian of innocence; it makes
men amiable to their friends, and respected by thei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>r
very enemies. In all places, and on all occasions, it
attracts benevolence, and demands approbation. One
might give instances out of antiquity<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> of the irresistible
force of this quality in great minds: Cicereius, and
Cneius Scipio, the son of the great Africanus, were
competitors for the office of pr&aelig;tor. The crowd followed
Cicereius, and left Scipio unattended. Cicereius
saw this with much concern, and desiring an audience
of the people, he descended from the place where the
candidates were to sit, in the eye of the multitude,
pleaded for his adversary, and with an ingenuous modesty
(which it is impossible to feign) represented to them,
how much it was to their dishonour, that a virtuous
son of Africanus should not be preferred to him, or any
other man whatsoever. This immediately gained the
election for Scipio; but all the compliments and
congratulations upon it were made to Cicereius. It is
easier in this case to say who had the office, than the
honour. There is no occurrence in life where this
quality is not more ornamental than any other. After
the battle of Pharsalia, Pompey marching towards
Larissus, the whole people of that place came out in
procession to do him honour. He thanked the magistrates
for their respect to him; but desired them to
perform these ceremonies to the conqueror. This
gallant submission to his fortune, and disdain of making
any appearance but like Pompey, was owing to his
modesty, which would not permit him to be so disingenuous
as to give himself the air of prosperity,
when he was in the contrary condition. This I say of
modesty, as it is the virtue which preserves a decorum
in the general course of our life; but considering it also
as it regards our mere bodies, it is the certain characte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>r
of a great mind. It is memorable of the mighty C&aelig;sar,
that when he was murdered in the Capitol, at the very
moment in which he expired, he gathered his robe
about him, that he might fall in a decent posture. In
this manner (says my author) he went off, not like a
man that departed out of life, but a deity that returned
to his abode."</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, October 28.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There is nothing which I contemplate with greater
pleasure than the dignity of human nature, which
often shows itself in all conditions of life: for notwithstanding
the degeneracy and meanness that is crept into
it, there are a thousand occasions in which it breaks
through its original corruption, and shows what it once
was, and what it will be hereafter. I consider the soul
of man as the ruin of a glorious pile of building;
where, amidst great heaps of rubbish, you meet with
noble fragments of sculpture, broken pillars and obelisks,
and a magnificence in confusion. Virtue and wisdom
are continually employed in clearing the ruins, removing
these disorderly heaps, recovering the noble pieces that
lie buried under them, and adjusting them as well as
possible according to their ancient symmetry and beauty.
A happy education, conversation with the finest spirits,
looking abroad into the works of nature, and observations
upon mankind, are the great assistances to this
necessary and glorious work. But even among those
who have never had the happiness of any of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
advantages, there are sometimes such exertions of the
greatness that is natural to the mind of man, as show
capacities and abilities, which only want these accidental
helps to fetch them out, and show them in a proper
light. A plebeian soul is still the ruin of this glorious
edifice, though encumbered with all its rubbish. This
reflection rose in me from a letter which my servant
dropped as he was dressing me, and which he told me
was communicated to him, as he is an acquaintance of
some of the persons mentioned in it. The epistle is
from one Sergeant Hall of the Foot Guards. It is
directed to Sergeant Cabe, in the Coldstream Regiment
of Foot Guards,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> at the Red Lettice<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> in the Butcher
Row,<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> near Temple Bar.</p>

<p>I was so pleased with several touches in it, that I
could not forbear showing it to a cluster of critics, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>,
instead of considering it in the light I have done,
examined it by the rules of epistolary writing: for as
these gentlemen are seldom men of any great genius,
they work altogether by mechanical rules, and are able
to discover no beauties that are not pointed out by
Bouhours and Rapin.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> The letter is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>From the Camp before Mons,<br />
September 26.</i></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Comrade</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I received yours, and am glad yourself and your wife
are in good health, with all the rest of my friends.
Our battalion suffered more than I could wish in the
action;<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> but who can withstand Fate? Poor Richard
Stephenson had his fate with a great many more: he

had above 200 of our battalion killed and wounded:
we lost 10 sergeants; 6 are as followeth: Jennings,

you have a better in the prints. Pray give my service

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>I am sorry for the sending such ill news. Her husband
was gathering a little money together to send to his
wife, and put it into my hands. I have seven shillings
and threepence, which I shall take care to send her.
Wishing your wife a safe delivery, and both of you all
happiness, rest</p>

<p class="center">"Your assured Friend and Comrade,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">John Hall.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"We had but an indifferent breakfast, but the
mounseers never had such a dinner in all their lives.</p>

<p>"My kind love to my comrade Hinton, and Mrs.
Morgan, and to John Brown and his wife. I sent two
shillings, and Stephenson sixpence, to drink with you at
Mr. Cook's; but I have heard nothing from him. It
was by Mr. Edgar.</p>

<p>"Corporal Hartwell desires to be remembered to you,
and desires you to inquire of Edgar, what is become of
his wife Peg; and when you write, to send word in your
letter what trade she drives.</p>

<p>"We have here very bad weather, which I doubt will
be a hindrance to the siege;<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> but I am in hopes we shall
be masters of the town in a little time, and then I believe
we shall go to garrison."</p>

<p>I saw the critics prepared to nibble at my letter;
therefore examined it myself, partly in their way, and
partly my own. "This is," said I, "truly a letter, and
an honest representation of that cheerful heart which
accompanies the poor soldier in his warfare. Is not there
in this all the topic of submitting to our destiny as well
discussed as if a greater man had been placed, like Brutus,
in his tent at midnight, reflecting on all the occurrences o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>f
past life, and saying fine things on "being" itself? What
Sergeant Hall knows of the matter, is, that he wishes
there had not been so many killed, and he had himself a
very bad shot in the head, and should recover if it pleased
God. But be that as it will, he takes care, like a man of
honour, as he certainly is, to let the widow Stephenson
know, that he had seven and threepence for her; and
that if he lives, he is sure he shall go into garrison at
last. I doubt not but all the good company at the Red
Lettice drank his health with as much real esteem as we
do any of our friends. All that I am concerned for, is,
that Mrs. Peggy Hartwell may be offended at showing
this letter, because her conduct in Mr. Hartwell's absence
is a little inquired into. But I could not sink that circumstance,
because you critics would have lost one of the
parts which I doubt not but you have much to say upon,
whether the familiar way is well hit in this style or not?
As for myself, I take a very particular satisfaction in
seeing any letter that is fit only for those to read who
are concerned in it, but especially on such a subject: for
if we consider the heap of an army, utterly out of all
prospect of rising and preferment, as they certainly are,
and such great things executed by them, it is hard to
account for the motive of their gallantry. But to me,
who was a cadet at the battle of Coldstream, in Scotland,
when Monck charged at the head of the regiment, now
called Coldstream from the victory of that day;<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> (I remember
it as well as if it were yesterday) I stood on the
left of old West, who I believe is now at Chelsea: I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>,
to me, who know very well this part of mankind, I take
the gallantry of private soldiers to proceed from the same,
if not from a nobler, impulse than that of gentlemen and
officers. They have the same taste of being acceptable
to their friends, and go through the difficulties of that
profession by the same irresistible charm of fellowship,
and the communication of joys and sorrows, which
quickens the relish of pleasure, and abates the anguish of
pain. Add to this, that they have the same regard to
fame, though they do not expect so great a share as men
above them hope for; but I will engage, Sergeant Hall
would die ten thousand deaths, rather than a word
should be spoken at the Red Lettice, or any part of the
Butcher Row, in prejudice to his courage or honesty. If
you will have my opinion then of the sergeant's letter, I
pronounce the style to be mixed, but truly epistolary; the
sentiment relating to his own wound, is in the sublime;
the postscript of Peg Hartwell, in the gay; and the
whole, the picture of the bravest sort of men, that is to
say, a man of great courage and small hopes."</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 28.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">When I came home this evening, I found, after many
attempts to vary my thoughts, that my head still
ran upon the subject of the discourse to-night at Will's.
I fell therefore into the amusement of proportioning the
glory of a battle among the whole army, and dividing it
into shares, according to the method of the Million
Lottery.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> In this bank of fame, by an exact calculation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>,
and the rules of political arithmetic, I have allotted ten
hundred thousand shares; five hundred thousand of
which is the due of the general, two hundred thousand I
assign to the general officers, and two hundred thousand
more to all the commissioned officers, from colonels to
ensigns; the remaining hundred thousand must be distributed
among the non-commissioned officers and private
men: according to which computation, I find Sergeant
Hall is to have one share and a fraction of two-fifths.
When I was a boy at Oxford, there was among the antiquities
near the theatre a great stone, on which were
engraven the names of all who fell in the battle of
Marathon. The generous and knowing people of Athens
understood the force of the desire of glory, and would
not let the meanest soldier perish in oblivion. Were the
natural impulse of the British animated with such monuments,
what man would be so mean as not to hazard his
life for his ten-hundred-thousandth part of the honour
in such a day as that of Blenheim or Blaregnies?</p>

From their colour, which was red, and their similarity to a lattice,
it was corruptly called the Red Lattice, which word is frequently used
by ancient writers to signify an ale-house (Nichols). Mr. Dobson
points out that Falstaff speaks of "red-lattice phrases" ("Merry

<hr class="chap" />


<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, October 31.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have lately received a letter from a friend in the
country, wherein he acquaints me, that two or
three men of the town are got among them, and have
brought down particular words and phrases which were
never before in those parts. He mentions in particular
the words "gunner" and "gunster," which my correspondent
observes they make use of when anything has
been related that is strange and surprising; and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
desires I would explain those terms, as I have many
others, for the information of such as live at a distance
from this town and court, which he calls the great mints
of language. His letter is dated from York; and (if he
tells me truth) a word in its ordinary circulation does not
reach that city within the space of five years after it is
first stamped. I cannot say how long these words have
been current in town, but I shall now take care to send
them down by the next post.</p>

<p>I must in the first place observe, that the words
"gunner" and "gunster" are not to be used promiscuously;
for a gunner, properly speaking, is not a gunster:
nor is a gunster, <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>, a gunner. They both indeed
are derived from the word "gun," and so far they agree.
But as a gun is remarkable for its destroying at a distance,
or for the report it makes, which is apt to startle all its
hearers, those who recount strange accidents and circumstances,
which have no manner of foundation in truth,
when they design to do mischief are comprehended under
the appellation of gunners; but when they endeavour
only to surprise and entertain, they are distinguished by
the name of gunsters. Gunners therefore are the pest
of society; but the gunsters often the diversion. The
gunner is destructive, and hated; the gunster innocent,
and laughed at. The first is prejudicial to others, the
other only to himself.</p>

<p>This being premised, I must in the next place subdivide
the gunner into several branches: all or the chief
of which are I think as follow:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, the Bombardier.</li>
<li>Secondly, the Miner.</li>
<li>Thirdly, the Squib.</li>
<li>Fourthly, the Serpent.</li>
</ul>


<p>And first, of the first. The bombardier tosses his balls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
sometimes into the midst of a city, with a design to fill
all around him with terror and combustion. He has
been sometimes known to drop a bomb in a Senate-house,
and to scatter a panic over a nation. But his
chief aim is at several eminent stations, which he
looks upon as the fairest marks, and uses all his skill
to do execution upon those who possess them. Every
man so situated, let his merit be never so great, is sure
to undergo a bombardment. It is further observed,
that the only way to be out of danger from the bursting
of a bomb, is to lie prostrate on the ground; a posture
too abject for generous spirits.</p>

<p>Secondly, the Miner.</p>

<p>As the bombardier levels his mischief at nations and
cities, the miner busies himself in ruining and overturning
private houses and particular persons. He
often acts as a spy, in discovering the secret avenues and
unguarded accesses of families, where, after he has made
his proper discoveries and dispositions, he sets sudden
fire to his train, that blows up families, scatters friends,
separates lovers, disperses kindred, and shakes a whole
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It is to be noted, that several females are great
proficients in this way of engineering. The marks by
which they are to be known, are a wonderful solicitude
for the reputation of their friends, and a more than
ordinary concern for the good of their neighbours.
There is also in them something so very like religion
as may deceive the vulgar; but if you look upon it very
nearly, you see on it such a cast of censoriousness, as
discovers it to be nothing but hypocrisy. Cleomilla is
a great instance of a female miner; but as my design is
to expose only the incorrigible, let her be silent for the
future, and I shall be so too.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirdly, the Squib.</p>

<p>The squibs are those who in the common phrase of
the world are called libellers, lampooners, and pamphleteers.
Their fireworks are made up in paper; and it
is observed, that they mix abundance of charcoal in
their powder, that they may be sure to blacken where
they cannot singe. These are observed to give a consternation
and disturbance only to weak minds; which,
according to the proverb, are always more afraid than
hurt.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Serpents.</p>

<p>The serpents are a petty kind of gunners, more pernicious
than any of the rest. They make use of a sort
of white powder, that goes off without any violent crack,
but gives a gentle sound, much like that of a whisper;
and is more destructive in all parts of life than any of
the materials made use of by any of the fraternity.</p>

<p>Come we now to the Gunsters.</p>

<p>This race of engineers deals altogether in wind-guns,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
which, by recoiling often, knock down those who discharge
them, without hurting anybody else; and
according to the various compressions of the air, make
such strange squeaks, cracks, pops, and bounces, as it i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>s
impossible to hear without laughing. It is observable,
however, that there is a disposition in a gunster to
become a gunner; and though their proper instruments
are only loaded with wind, they often, out of wantonness,
fire a bomb, or spring a mine, out of their natural
inclination to engineering; by which means they do
mischief when they don't design it, and have their bones
broken when they don't deserve it.</p>

<p>This sort of engineers are the most unaccountable
race of men in the world: some of them have received
above a hundred wounds, and yet have not a scar in
their bodies; some have debauched multitudes of women
who have died maids. You may be with them from
morning till night, and the next day they shall tell you
a thousand adventures that happened when you were
with them, which you know nothing of. They have a
quality of having been present at everything they hear
related; and never heard a man commended who was
not their intimate acquaintance, if not their kinsman.</p>

<p>I hope these notes may serve as a rough draught for
a new establishment of engineers, which I shall hereafter
fill up with proper persons, according to my own
observations on their conduct, having already had one
recommended to me for the general of my artillery.
But that, and all the other posts, I intend to keep open,
till I can inform myself of the candidates, having
resolved in this case to depend no more upon their
friend's word than I would upon their own.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, October 31.</i><a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was this morning awakened by a sudden shake of the
house; and as soon as I had got a little out of my
consternation, I felt another, which was followed by tw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>o
or three repetitions of the same convulsion. I got up as
fast as possible, girt on my rapier, and snatched up my
hat, when my landlady came up to me, and told me,
that the gentlewoman of the next house begged me to
step thither; for that a lodger she had taken in was run
mad, and she desired my advice; as indeed everybody
in the whole lane does upon important occasions. I am
not like some artists, saucy because I can be beneficial,
but went immediately. Our neighbour told us, she had
the day before let her second floor to a very genteel
youngish man, who told her, he kept extraordinary good
hours, and was generally at home most part of the
morning and evening at study; but that this morning
he had for an hour together made this extravagant
noise which we then heard. I went upstairs with my
hand upon the hilt of my rapier, and approached this
new lodger's door. I looked in at the key-hole, and
there I saw a well-made man look with great attention
on a book, and on a sudden, jump into the air so high,
that his head almost touched the ceiling. He came
down safe on his right foot, and again flew up, alighting
on his left; then looked again at his book, and holding
out his right leg, put it into such a quivering motion,
that I thought he would have shaken it off. He used
the left after the same manner, when on a sudden, to
my great surprise, he stooped himself incredibly low,
and turned gently on his toes. After this circular
motion, he continued bent in that humble posture for
some time, looking on his book. After this, he recovered
himself with a sudden spring, and flew round
the room in all the violence and disorder imaginable, till
he made a full pause for want of breath. In this interim
my woman asked what I thought: I whispered, that I
thought this learned person an enthusiast, who possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
had his first education in the peripatetic way, which was
a sect of philosophers who always studied when walking.
But observing him much out of breath, I thought it the
best time to master him if he were disordered, and
knocked at his door. I was surprised to find him open
it, and say with great civility and good mien, that he
hoped he had not disturbed us. I believed him in a
lucid interval, and desired he would please to let me see
his book. He did so, smiling. I could not make
anything of it, and therefore asked in what language it
was written. He said, it was one he studied with great
application; but it was his profession to teach it, and
could not communicate his knowledge without a consideration.
I answered, that I hoped he would hereafter
keep his thoughts to himself; for his meditation this
morning had cost me three coffee-dishes and a clean
pipe. He seemed concerned at that, and told me, he
was a dancing-master, and had been reading a dance or
two before he went out, which had been written by one
who taught at an academy in France.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> He observed
me at a stand, and went on to inform me, that now
articulate motions, as well as sounds, were expressed by
proper characters, and that there is nothing so common
as to communicate a dance by a letter. I besought him
hereafter to meditate in a ground room, for that otherwise
it would be impossible for an artist of any other
kind to live near him; and that I was sure, several of hi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>s
thoughts this morning would have shaken my spectacles
off my nose, had I been myself at study.</p>

<p>I then took my leave of this virtuoso, and returned to
my chamber, meditating on the various occupations of
rational creatures.</p>

<h3><i>Grecian Coffee-house, Nov. 2.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have received this short epistle from an unknown
hand:<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I have no more to trouble you with, than to desire
you would in your next help me to some answer
to the enclosed concerning yourself. In the meantime
I congratulate you upon the increase of your fame,
which you see has extended itself beyond the bills of
mortality.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"'<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"'That the country is barren of news, has been the
excuse time out of mind for dropping a correspondence
with our friends in London; as if it were
impossible out of a coffee-house to write an agreeable
letter. I am too ingenuous to endeavour at the covering
of my negligence with so common an excuse. Doubtless,
amongst friends bred as we have been, to the knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>of books as well as men, a letter dated from a garden,
a grotto, a fountain, a wood, a meadow, or the banks of
a river, may be more entertaining than one from Tom's,<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
Will's, White's, or St. James's. I promise therefore to
be frequent for the future in my rural dates to you:
but for fear you should, from what I have said, be
induced to believe I shun the commerce of men, I must
inform you, that there is a fresh topic of discourse lately
risen amongst the ingenious in our part of the world, and
is become the more fashionable for the ladies giving into
it. This we owe to Isaac Bickerstaff, who is very much
censured by some, and as much justified by others.
Some criticise his style, his humour, and his matter;
others admire the whole man: some pretend, from the
informations of their friends in town, to decipher the
author; and others confess they are lost in their guesses.
For my part, I must own myself a professed admirer of
the paper, and desire you to send me a complete set,
together with your thoughts of the squire and his
lucubrations.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no pleasure like that of receiving praise from
the praiseworthy; and I own it a very solid happiness,
that these my lucubrations are approved by a person of
so fine a taste as the author of this letter, who is capable
of enjoying the world in the simplicity of its natural
beauties. This pastoral letter, if I may so call it, must
be written by a man who carries his entertainment
wherever he goes, and is undoubtedly one of those happ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>y
men who appear far otherwise to the vulgar. I daresay,
he is not envied by the vicious, the vain, the frolic, and
the loud; but is continually blessed with that strong
and serious delight which flows from a well-taught and
liberal mind. With great respect to country sports, I
may say, this gentleman could pass his time agreeably
if there were not a hare or a fox in his county. That
calm and elegant satisfaction which the vulgar call
melancholy, is the true and proper delight of men of
knowledge and virtue. What we take for diversion,
which is a kind of forgetting ourselves, is but a mean
way of entertainment, in comparison of that which is
considering, knowing, and enjoying ourselves. The
pleasures of ordinary people are in their passions; but
the seat of this delight is in the reason and understanding.
Such a frame of mind raises that sweet
enthusiasm which warms the imagination at the sight
of every work of nature, and turns all around you into
picture and landscape. I shall be ever proud of advices
from this gentleman; for I profess writing news from
the learned as well as the busy world.</p>

<p>As for my labours, which he is pleased to inquire
after, if they can but wear one impertinence out of
human life, destroy a single vice, or give a morning's
cheerfulness to an honest mind; in short, if the world
can be but one virtue the better, or in any degree less
vicious, or receive from them the smallest addition to
their innocent diversions, I shall not think my pains, or
indeed my life, to have been spent in vain.</p>

<p>Thus far as to my studies. It will be expected I should
in the next place give some account of my life. I shall
therefore, for the satisfaction of the present age, and the
benefit of posterity, present the world with the following
abridgment of it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>It is remarkable, that I was bred by hand, and ate
nothing but milk till I was a twelvemonth old; from
which time, to the eighth year of my age, I was observed
to delight in pudding and potatoes; and indeed I retain
a benevolence for that sort of food to this day. I do not
remember that I distinguished myself in anything at
those years, but by my great skill at taw, for which I
was so barbarously used, that it has ever since given me
an aversion to gaming. In my twelfth year, I suffered
very much for two or three false concords. At fifteen,
I was sent to the university, and stayed there for some
time; but a drum passing by (being a lover of music),
I listed myself for a soldier.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> As years came on, I began
to examine things, and grew discontented at the times.
This made me quit the sword, and take to the study of
the occult sciences, in which I was so wrapped up, that
Oliver Cromwell had been buried, and taken up again,
five years before I heard he was dead. This gave me
first the reputation of a conjurer, which has been of
great disadvantage to me ever since, and kept me out of
all public employments. The greater part of my later
years has been divided between Dick's Coffee-house, the
Trumpet in Sheer Lane, and my own lodgings.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 2.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The evil of unseasonable visits has been complained of
to me with much vehemence by persons of both sexes;
and I am desired to consider this very important circumstance,
that men may know how to regulate their conduct
in an affair which concerns no less than life itself. For
to a rational creature, it is almost the same cruelty to
attack his life, by robbing him of so many moments of
his time, or so many drops of his blood. The author o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>f
the following letter has a just delicacy on this point, and
has put it into a very good light.</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Mr. Bickerstaff</span>,</p>
<p class="right"><i>Oct. 29.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap">I am very much afflicted with the gravel, which
makes me sick and peevish. I desire to know of
you, if it be reasonable that any of my acquaintance
should take advantage over me at this time, and afflict
me with long visits, because they are idle, and I am confined.
Pray, sir, reform the town in this matter. Men
never consider whether the sick person be disposed for
company, but make their visits to humour themselves.
You may talk upon this topic, so as to oblige all persons
afflicted with chronic distempers, among which I reckon
visits. Don't think me a sour man, for I love conversation
and my friends; but I think one's most intimate
friend may be too familiar, and that there are such
things as unseasonable wit and painful mirth."</p>

<p>It is with some so hard a thing to employ their time,
that it is a great good fortune when they have a friend
indisposed, that they may be punctual in perplexing him,
when he is recovered enough to be in that state which
cannot be called sickness or health; when he is too well
to deny company, and too ill to receive them. It is no
uncommon case, if a man is of any figure or power in
the world, to be congratulated into a relapse.</p>


<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 2.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was very well pleased this evening to hear a gentleman
express a very becoming indignation against a practice
which I myself have been very much offended at. "There
is nothing," said he, "more ridiculous than for an actor
to insert words of his own in the part he is to act, so that
it is impossible to see the poet for the player: you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
have Pinkethman and Bullock helping out Beaumont
and Fletcher. It puts me in mind," continued he, "of
a collection of antique statues which I once saw in a
gentleman's possession, who employed a neighbouring
stone-cutter to add noses, ears, arms, or legs, to the
maimed works of Phidias or Praxiteles. You may be sure
this addition disfigured the statues much more than time
had. I remember a Venus that, by the nose he had given
her, looked like Mother Shipton; and a Mercury with a
pair of legs that seemed very much swelled with a dropsy."</p>

<p>I thought the gentleman's observations very proper;
and he told me, I had improved his thought, in mentioning
on this occasion those wise commentators who had
filled up the hemistichs of Virgil;<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> particularly that
notable poet, who, to make the "&AElig;neid" more perfect,
carried on the story to Lavinia's wedding.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> If the
proper officer will not condescend to take notice of these
absurdities, I shall myself, as a censor of the people,
animadvert upon such proceedings.</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 4.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The passion of love happened to be the subject of
discourse between two or three of us at the table
of the poets this evening; and among other observations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>,
it was remarked, that the same sentiment on this passion
had run through all languages and nations. Menmius,
who has a very good taste, fell into a little sort of dissertation
on this occasion. "It is," said he, "remarkable,
that no passion has been treated by all who have
touched upon it with the same bent of design but this.
The poets, the moralists, the painters, in all their descriptions,
allegories, and pictures, have represented it as a
soft torment, a bitter sweet, a pleasing pain, or an agreeable
distress, and have only expressed the same thought
in a different manner. The<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> joining of pleasure and
pain together in such devices, seems to me the only
pointed thought I ever read which is natural; and it
must have proceeded from its being the universal sense
and experience of mankind, that they have all spoken
of it in the same manner. I have in my own reading
remarked a hundred and three epigrams, fifty odes, and
ninety-one sentences tending to this sole purpose. It is
certain, there is no other passion which does produce
such contrary effects in so great a degree: but this may
be said for love, that if you strike it out of the soul,
life would be insipid, and our being but half animated.
Human nature would sink into deadness and lethargy,
if not quickened with some active principle; and as for
all others, whether ambition, envy, or avarice, which are
apt to possess the mind in the absence of this passion, it
must be allowed that they have greater pains, without
the compensation of such exquisite pleasures as those we
find in love. The great skill is to heighten the satisfactions,
and deaden the sorrows of it, which has been the
end of many of my labours, and shall continue to be so
for the service of the world in general, and in particular
of the fair sex who are always the best or the worst par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>t
of it. It is pity that a passion which has in it a capacity
of making life happy, should not be cultivated to the
utmost advantage. Reason, prudence, and good-nature,
rightly applied, can thoroughly accomplish this great end,
provided they have always a real and constant love to
work upon. But this subject I shall treat more at large
in the history of my married sister; and in the meantime,
shall conclude my reflection on the pains and
pleasures which attend this passion with one of the finest
allegories which I think I have ever read. It is invented
by the divine Plato, and to show the opinion he himself
had of it, ascribed by him to his admired Socrates, whom
he represents as discoursing with his friends, and giving
the history of love in the following manner:</p>

<p>"At the birth of Beauty," says he, "there was a great
feast made, and many guests invited: among the rest
was the god Plenty, who was the son of the goddess
Prudence, and inherited many of his mother's virtues.
After a full entertainment, he retired into the garden of
Jupiter, which was hung with a great variety of ambrosial
fruits, and seems to have been a very proper retreat for
such a guest. In the meantime an unhappy female,
called Poverty, having heard of this great feast, repaired
to it in hopes of finding relief. The first place she lights
upon was Jupiter's garden, which generally stands open
to people of all conditions. Poverty enters, and by
chance finds the god Plenty asleep in it. She was immediately
fired with his charms, laid herself down by his
side, and managed matters so well that she conceived a
child by him. The world was very much in suspense
upon the occasion, and could not imagine to themselves
what would be the nature of an infant that was to have
its original from two such parents. At the last, the child
appears; and who should it be but Love. This infant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
grew up, and proved in all his behaviour what he really
was, a compound of opposite beings. As he is the son
of Plenty (who was the offspring of Prudence), he is
subtle, intriguing, full of stratagems and devices; as the
son of Poverty, he is fawning, begging, serenading, delighting
to lie at a threshold or beneath a window. By
the father, he is audacious, full of hopes, conscious of
merit, and therefore quick of resentment: by the mother,
he is doubtful, timorous, mean-spirited, fearful of offending,
and abject in submissions. In the same hour you
may see him transported with raptures, talking of immortal
pleasures, and appearing satisfied as a god; and
immediately after, as the mortal mother prevails in his
composition, you behold him pining, languishing, despairing,
dying."</p>

<p>I have been always wonderfully delighted with fables,
allegories, and the like inventions, which the politest and
the best instructors of mankind have always made use of:
they take off from the severity of instruction, and enforce
it at the same time that they conceal it. The supposing
Love to be conceived immediately after the birth of
Beauty, the parentage of Plenty, and the inconsistency
of this passion with itself so naturally derived to it, are
great master-strokes in this fable; and if they fell into
good hands, might furnish out a more pleasing canto
than any in Spenser.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 4.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I came home this evening in a very pensive mood; and
to divert me, took up a volume of Shakespeare, where
I chanced to cast my eye upon a part in the tragedy of
"Richard the Third," which filled my mind with a very
agreeable horror. It was the scene in which that bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
but wicked prince is represented as sleeping in his tent
the night before the battle in which he fell. The poet
takes that occasion to set before him in a vision a terrible
assembly of apparitions, the ghosts of all those innocent
persons whom he is said to have murdered. Prince
Edward, Henry VI., the Duke of Clarence, Rivers, Gray,
and Vaughan, Lord Hastings, the two young princes, sons
to Edward IV., his own wife, and the Duke of Buckingham
rise up in their blood before him, beginning their speeches
with that dreadful salutation, "Let me sit heavy on thy
soul to-morrow;" and concluding with that dismal
sentence, "Despair and die." This inspires the tyrant
with a dream of his past guilt, and of the approaching
vengeance. He anticipates the fatal day of Bosworth,
fancies himself dismounted, weltering in his own blood;
and in the agonies of despair (before he is thoroughly
awake), starts up with the following speech:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Give me another horse&mdash;Bind up my wounds!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Have mercy, Jesu&mdash;Soft, I did but dream.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>O coward Conscience! How dost thou afflict me?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The lights burn blue! Is it not dead midnight?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>What do I fear? Myself!</i> &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A scene written with so great strength of imagination
indisposed me from further reading, and threw me into
a deep contemplation. I began to reflect upon the
different ends of good and bad kings; and as this was
the birthday of our late renowned monarch,<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> I could
not forbear thinking on the departure of that excellent
prince, whose life was crowned with glory, and his death
with peace. I let my mind go so far into this thought,
as to imagine to myself, what might have been th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>e
vision of his departing slumbers. He might have seen
confederate kings applauding him in different languages,
slaves that had been bound in fetters lifting up their
hands and blessing him, and the persecuted in their
several forms of worship imploring comfort on his last
moments. The reflection upon this excellent prince's
mortality had been a very melancholy entertainment to
me, had I not been relieved by the consideration of the
glorious reign which succeeds it.</p>

<p>We now see as great a virtue as ever was on the
British throne, surrounded with all the beauty of success.
Our nation may not only boast of a long series of great,
regular, and well-laid designs, but also of triumphs and
victories; while we have the happiness to see our
sovereign exercise that true policy which tends to make
a kingdom great and happy, and at the same time enjoy
the good and glorious effect of it.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 7.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was very much surprised this evening with a visit
from one of the top toasts of the town, who came
privately in a chair, and bolted into my room, while
I was reading a chapter of Agrippa upon the occult
sciences; but as she entered with all the air and bloom
that nature ever bestowed on woman, I threw down the
conjurer, and met the charmer. I had no sooner placed
her at my right hand by the fire, but she opened to me
the reason of her visit. "Mr. Bickerstaff," said the
fine creature, "I have been your correspondent some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
time, though I never saw you before; I have writ by
the name of Maria.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> You have told me you were too
far gone in life to think of love; therefore I am
answered as to the passion I spoke of, and," continued
she, smiling, "I will not stay till you grow young
again (as you men never fail to do in your dotage), but
am come to consult you about disposing of myself to
another. My person you see; my fortune is very
considerable; but I am at present under much perplexity
how to act in a great conjuncture. I have two
lovers, Crassus and Lorio. Crassus is prodigiously rich,
but has no one distinguishing quality; though at the same
time he is not remarkable on the defective side. Lorio
has travelled, is well bred, pleasant in discourse, discreet
in his conduct, agreeable in his person; and with all
this, he has a competency of fortune without superfluity.
When I consider Lorio, my mind is filled with an idea
of the great satisfactions of a pleasant conversation.
When I think of Crassus, my equipage, numerous
servants, gay liveries, and various dresses are opposed
to the charms of his rival. In a word, when I cast my
eyes upon Lorio, I forget and despise fortune; when I
behold Crassus, I think only of pleasing my vanity, and
enjoying an uncontrolled expense in all the pleasures
of life, except love." She paused here. "Madam,"
said I, "I am confident you have not stated your case
with sincerity, and that there is some secret pang which
you have concealed from me: for I see by your aspect
the generosity of your mind; and that open ingenuous
air lets me know, that you have too great a sense of the
generous passion of love, to prefer the ostentation of
life in the arms of Crassus, to the entertainments and
conveniences of it in the company of your beloved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>Lorio; for so he is indeed, madam. You speak his
name with a different accent from the rest of your
discourse: the idea his image raises in you, gives new
life to your features, and new grace to your speech.
Nay, blush not, madam, there is no dishonour in loving
a man of merit: I assure you, I am grieved at this
dallying with yourself, when you put another in competition
with him, for no other reason but superior
wealth." "To tell you then," said she, "the bottom of
my heart, there's Clotilda lies by, and plants herself in
the way of Crassus, and I am confident will snap him,
if I refuse him. I cannot bear to think that she will shine
above me. When our coaches meet, to see her chariot
hung behind with four footmen, and mine with but
two: hers, powdered, gay, and saucy, kept only for
show; mine, a couple of careful rogues that are good for
something: I own, I cannot bear that Clotilda should be
in all the pride and wantonness of wealth, and I only
in the ease and affluence of it." Here I interrupted:
"Well, madam, now I see your whole affliction: you
could be happy, but that you fear another would be
happier; or rather, you could be solidly happy, but
that another is to be happy in appearance. This is an
evil which you must get over, or never know happiness.
We will put the case, madam, that you married Crassus,
and she Lorio." She answered, "Speak not of it&mdash;I
could tear her eyes out at the mention of it." "Well,
then, I pronounce Lorio to be the man: but I must tell
you, that what we call settling in the world, is in a kind
leaving it; and you must at once resolve to keep your
thoughts of happiness within the reach of your fortune,
and not measure it by comparison with others. But
indeed, madam, when I behold that beauteous form of
yours, and consider the generality of your sex, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
their disposal of themselves in marriage, or their parents
doing it for them without their own approbation, I
cannot but look upon all such matches as the most
impudent prostitutions. Do but observe when you are
at a play, the familiar wenches that sit laughing among
the men. These appear detestable to you in the boxes:
each of them would give up her person for a guinea;
and some of you would take the worst there for life for
twenty thousand. If so, how do you differ but in price?
As to the circumstance of marriage, I take that to be
hardly an alteration of the case; for wedlock is but a
more solemn prostitution where there is not a union
of minds. You would hardly believe it, but there have
been designs even upon me. A neighbour in this very
lane, who knows I have, by leading a very wary life, laid
up a little money, had a great mind to marry me to
his daughter. I was frequently invited to their table.
The girl was always very pleasant and agreeable. After
dinner, Miss Molly would be sure to fill my pipe
for me, and put more sugar than ordinary into my
coffee; for she was sure I was good-natured. If I
chanced to hem, the mother would applaud my vigour;
and has often said on that occasion, 'I wonder, Mr.
Bickerstaff, you don't marry; I am sure you would have
children.' Things went so far that my mistress
presented me with a wrought nightcap and a laced
band of her own working. I began to think of it in
earnest; but one day, having an occasion to ride to
Islington, as two or three people were lifting me upon
my pad, I spied her at a convenient distance laughing at
her lover, with a parcel of romps of her acquaintance:
one of them, who I suppose had the same design upon
me, told me she said, 'Do you see how briskly my
old gentleman mounts?' This made me cut off my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
amour, and to reflect with myself, that no married life
could be so unhappy, as where the wife proposes no
other advantage from her husband, than that of making
herself fine, and keeping her out of the dirt."</p>

<p>My fair client burst out a-laughing at the account I
gave her of my escape, and went away seemingly convinced
of the reasonableness of my discourse to her.</p>

<p>As soon as she was gone, my maid brought up the
following epistle, which by the style and the description
she gave of the person, I suppose was left by Nick
Doubt. "Harkee," said he, "girl, tell old Basket-hilt,
I would have him answer it by the first opportunity."
What he says is this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Isaac</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"You seem a very honest fellow; therefore pray tell
me, did not you write that letter in praise of the
squire and his lucubrations yourself?" &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The greatest plague of coxcombs is, that they often
break upon you with an impertinent piece of good sense,
as this jackanapes has hit me in a right place enough.
I must confess, I am as likely to play such a trick as
another; but that letter he speaks of was really genuine.
When I first set up, I thought it fair enough to let
myself know from all parts that my works were wonderfully
inquired for, and were become the diversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>,
as well as instruction, of all the choice spirits in every
county of Great Britain. I do not doubt but the more
intelligent of my readers found it, before this jackanapes
(I can call him no better) took upon him to observe
upon my style and my basket-hilt. A very pleasant
gentleman of my acquaintance told me one day a story
of this kind of falsehood and vanity in an author.
M&aelig;vius showed him a paper of verses, which he said he
had received that morning by the penny post from an
unknown hand. My friend admired them extremely.
"Sir," said he, "this must come from a man that is
eminent: you see fire, life, and spirit run through the
whole, and at the same time a correctness, which shows
he is used to writing. Pray, Sir, read them over again."
He begins again, title and all: "To M&aelig;vius on his
incomparable poems." The second reading was performed
with much more vehemence and action than
the former; after which my friend fell into downright
raptures. "Why, they are truly sublime! There is
energy in this line! description in that! Why, it is the
thing itself! This is perfect picture!" M&aelig;vius could
bear no more; "but, faith," says he, "Ned, to tell you
the plain truth, I writ them myself."</p>

<p>There goes just such another story of the same paternal
tenderness in Bavius, an ingenious contemporary of mine,
who had written several comedies, which were rejected by
the players. This my friend Bavius took for envy, and
therefore prevailed upon a gentleman to go with him to
the play-house, and gave him a new play of his, desiring
he would personate the author, and read it, to baffle the
spite of the actors. The friend consented, and to reading
they went. They had not gone over three similes before
Roscius the player made the acting author stop, and desired
to know, what he meant by such a rapture? and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
how it came to pass, that in this condition of the lover,
instead of acting according to his circumstances, he spent
his time in considering what his present state was like?
"That is very true," says the mock-author, "I believe
we had as good strike these lines out." "By your leave,"
says M&aelig;vius, "you shall not spoil your play, you are too
modest; those very lines, for aught I know, are as good
as any in your play, and they shall stand." Well, they
go on, and the particle "and" stood unfortunately at
the end of a verse, and was made to rhyme to the word
"stand." This Roscius excepted against. The new poet
gave up that too, and said, he would not dispute for a
monosyllable&mdash;"For a monosyllable!" says the real
author; "I can assure you, a monosyllable may be of as
great force as a word of ten syllables. I tell you, sir,
'and' is the connection of the matter in that place; without
that word, you may put all that follows into any
other play as well as this. Besides, if you leave it out,
it will look as if you had put it in only for the sake of
the rhyme." Roscius persisted, assuring the gentleman,
that it was impossible to speak it but the "and" must
be lost; so it might as well be blotted out. Bavius
snatched his play out of their hands, said they were both
blockheads, and went off; repeating a couplet, because
he would not make his exit irregularly. A witty man of
these days compared this true and feigned poet to the

<h3><i>White's Chocolate-house, Nov. 9.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I know no manner of speaking so offensive as that of
giving praise, and closing it with an exception; which
proceeds (where men do not do it to introduce malice,
and make calumny more effectual) from the common
error of considering man as a perfect creature. But if
we rightly examine things, we shall find, that there is a
sort of economy in Providence, that one shall excel where
another is defective, in order to make men more useful
to each other, and mix them in society. This man having
this talent, and that man another, is as necessary in conversation,
as one professing one trade, and another another,
is beneficial in commerce. The happiest climate does not
produce all things; and it was so ordered, that one part
of the earth should want the product of another, for
uniting mankind in a general correspondence and good
understanding. It is therefore want of good sense as
well as good nature, to say, Simplicius has a better judgment,
but not so much wit, as Latius; for that these
have not each other's capacities, is no more a diminution
to either than if you should say, Simplicius is not Latius,
or Latius not Simplicius. The heathen world had so
little notion that perfection was to be expected amongst
men, that among them any one quality or endowment in
an heroic degree made a god. Hercules had strength;
but it was never objected to him that he wanted wit.
Apollo presided over wit, and it was never asked whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
he had strength. We hear no exceptions against the
beauty of Minerva, or the wisdom of Venus. These
wise heathens were glad to immortalise any one serviceable
gift, and overlook all imperfections in the person
who had it; but with us it is far otherwise, for we reject
many eminent virtues, if they are accompanied with one
apparent weakness. The reflecting after this manner,
made me account for the strange delight men take in
reading lampoons and scandal, with which the age abounds,
and of which I receive frequent complaints. Upon mature
consideration, I find it is principally for this reason that
the worst of mankind, the libellers, receive so much encouragement
in the world. The low race of men take a
secret pleasure in finding an eminent character levelled to
their condition by a report of its defects, and keep themselves
in countenance, though they are excelled in a
thousand virtues, if they believe they have in common
with a great person any one fault. The libeller falls in
with this humour, and gratifies this baseness of temper,
which is naturally an enemy to extraordinary merit. It
is from this that libel and satire are promiscuously joined
together in the notions of the vulgar, though the satirist
and libeller differ as much as the magistrate and the
murderer. In the consideration of human life, the satirist
never falls upon persons who are not glaringly faulty,
and the libeller on none but who are conspicuously commendable.
Were I to expose any vice in a good or great
man, it should certainly be by correcting it in some one
where that crime was the most distinguishing part of the
character; as pages are chastised for the admonition of
princes.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> When it is performed otherwise, the viciou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>s
are kept in credit by placing men of merit in the same
accusation. But all the pasquils,<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> lampoons, and libels
we meet with nowadays, are a sort of playing with the
four-and-twenty letters, and throwing them into names
and characters, without sense, truth, or wit. In this case,
I am in great perplexity to know whom they mean, and
should be in distress for those they abuse, if I did not
see their judgment and ingenuity in those they commend.
This is the true way of examining a libel; and when men
consider, that no one man living thinks the better of
their heroes and patrons for the panegyric given them,
none can think themselves lessened by their invective.
The hero or patron in a libel is but a scavenger to carry
off the dirt, and by that very employment is the filthiest
creature in the street. Dedications and panegyrics are
frequently ridiculous, let them be addressed where they
will; but at the front, or in the body of a libel, to commend
a man, is saying to the persons applauded, "My
Lord, or Sir, I have pulled down all men that the rest
of the world think great and honourable, and here is a
clear stage; you may as you please be valiant or wise;
you may choose to be on the military or civil list; for
there is no one brave who commands, or just who has
power: you may rule the world now it is empty, which
exploded you when it was full: I have knocked out the
brains of all whom mankind thought good for anything;
and I doubt not but you will reward that invention which
found out the only expedient to make your Lordship, or
your Worship, of any consideration."</p>

<p>Had I the honour to be in a libel, and had escaped
the approbation of the author, I should look upon it
exactly in this manner. But though it is a thing thus
perfectly indifferent, who is exalted or debased in suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>h
performances, yet it is not so with relation to the authors
of them; therefore I shall, for the good of my country,
hereafter take upon me to punish these wretches. What
is already passed, may die away according to its nature,
and continue in its present oblivion; but for the future, I
shall take notice of such enemies to honour and virtue,
and preserve them to immortal infamy. Their names shall
give fresh offence many ages hence, and be detested a
thousand years after the commission of their crime. It
shall not avail, that these children of infamy publish
their works under feigned names, or under none at all;
for I am so perfectly well acquainted with the styles of
all my contemporaries, that I shall not fail of doing
them justice, with their proper names, and at their full
length. Let therefore these miscreants enjoy their present
act of oblivion, and take care how they offend hereafter.
But to avert our eyes from such objects, it is
methinks but requisite to settle our opinion in the case
of praise and blame; and I believe, the only true way to
cure that sensibility of reproach, which is a common
weakness with the most virtuous men, is to fix their
regard firmly upon only what is strictly true, in relation
to their advantage, as well as diminution. For
if I am pleased with commendation which I do not
deserve, I shall from the same temper be concerned at
scandal I do not deserve. But he that can think of false
applause with as much contempt as false detraction, will
certainly be prepared for all adventures, and will become
all occasions. Undeserved praise can please only those
who want merit, and undeserved reproach frighten only
those who want sincerity.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> I have thought of this with
so much attention, that I fancy there can be no other
method in nature found for the cure of that delicac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>y
which gives good men pain under calumny, but placing
satisfaction nowhere but in a just sense of their own
integrity, without regard to the opinion of others. If
we have not such a foundation as this, there is no help
against scandal, but being in obscurity, which to noble
minds is not being at all. The truth of it is, this love
of praise dwells most in great and heroic spirits; and
those who best deserve it have generally the most exquisite
relish of it. Methinks I see the renowned Alexander,
after a painful and laborious march, amidst the heats of
a parched soil and a burning climate, sitting over the
head of a fountain, and after a draught of water, pronounce
that memorable saying, "O Athenians! how
much do I suffer that you may speak well of me?" The
Athenians were at that time the learned of the world,
and their libels against Alexander were written as he was
a professed enemy of their state: but how monstrous
would such invectives have appeared in Macedonians?</p>

<p>As love of reputation is a darling passion in great
men, so the defence of them in this particular is the
business of every man of honour and honesty. We
should run on such an occasion (as if a public building
was on fire) to their relief; and all who spread or publish
such detestable pieces as traduce their merit, should
be used like incendiaries. It is the common cause of
our country, to support the reputation of those who
preserve it against invaders; and every man is attacked
in the person of that neighbour who deserves well of
him.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 9.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The chat I had to-day at White's about fame and
scandal, put me in mind of a person who has often
written to me unregarded, and has a very moderate am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>bition
in this particular. His name it seems is Charles
Lillie, and he recommends himself to my observation as
one that sold snuff next door to the Fountain Tavern,
in the Strand, and was burnt out when he began to
have a reputation in his way.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I suppose, through a hurry of business, you have
either forgotten me, or lost my last of this nature;
which was, to beg the favour of being advantageously
exposed in your paper, chiefly for the reputation of snuff.
Be pleased to pardon this trouble, from,</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>
<p class="center">Your very humble Servant,</p>
<p class="right">C. L.</p>

<p>"I am a perfumer, at the corner of Beauford Buildings,
in the Strand."</p></blockquote>

<p>This same Charles leaves it to me to say what I will
of him, and I am not a little pleased with the ingenuous
manner of his address. Taking snuff is what I have
declared against; but as his Holiness the Pope allows
whoring for the taxes raised by the ladies of pleasure, so
I, to repair the loss of an unhappy trader, indulge all
persons in that custom who buy of Charles. There is
something so particular in the request of the man, that I
shall send for him before me, and believe I shall find he
has a genius for baubles: if so, I shall, for aught I know,
at his shop, give licensed canes to those who are really
lame, and tubes to those who are unfeignedly short-sighted;
and forbid all others to vend the same.</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 11.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The French humour of writing epistles, and publishing
their fulsome compliments to each other, is a
thing I frequently complain of in this place. It is,
methinks, from the prevalence of this silly custom that
there is so little instruction in the conversation of our
distant friends; for which reason, during the whole
course of my life, I have desired my acquaintance, when
they write to me, rather to say something which should
make me wish myself with them, than make me compliments
that they wished themselves with me. By
this means, I have by me a collection of letters from
most parts of the world, which are as naturally of the
growth of the place as any herb, tree, or plant of the
soil. This I take to be the proper use of an epistolary
commerce. To desire to know how Damon goes on with
his courtship to Silvia, or how the wine tastes at the
Old Devil, are threadbare subjects, and cold treats,
which our absent friends might have given us without
going out of town for them. A friend of mine who
went to travel, used me far otherwise; for he gave me a
prospect of the place, or an account of the people, from
every country through which he passed. Among others
which I was looking over this evening, I am not a little
delighted with this which follows:<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I believe this is the first letter that was ever sent you
from the middle region, where I am at this present
writing. Not to keep you in suspense, it comes to
you from the top of the highest mountain in Switzerland,
where I am now shivering among the eternal frosts
and snows. I can scarce forbear dating it in December,
though they call it the first of August at the bottom of
the mountain. I assure you, I can hardly keep my ink
from freezing in the middle of the dog-days. I am here
entertained with the prettiest variety of snow prospects
that you can imagine, and have several pits of it before
me that are very near as old as the mountain itself; for
in this country it is as lasting as marble. I am now
upon a spot of it which they tell me fell about the reign
of Charlemagne or King Pepin. The inhabitants of the
country are as great curiosities as the country itself: they
generally hire themselves out in their youth, and if they
are musket-proof till about fifty, they bring home the
money they have got, and the limbs they have left, to
pass the rest of their time among their native mountains.
One of the gentlemen of the place, who is come off with
the loss of an eye only, told me by way of boast, that
there were now seven wooden legs in his family; and
that for these four generations, there had not been one
in his line that carried a whole body with him to the
grave. I believe you will think the style of this letter a
little extraordinary; but the 'Rehearsal' will tell you,
that people in clouds must not be confined to speak
sense;<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and I hope we that are above them ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>y
claim the same privilege. Wherever I am, I shall
always be,</p>

<p>"Sir,</p>
<p class="center">Your most obedient,</p>
<p class="right">Most humble Servant."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think they ought, in those parts where the materials
are so easy to work, and at the same time so durable,
when any one of their heroes comes home from the
wars, to erect his statue in snow upon the mountains,
there to remain from generation to generation. A gentleman
who is apt to expatiate upon any hint, took this
occasion to deliver his opinion upon our ordinary method
of sending young gentlemen to travel for their education.
"It is certain," said he, "if gentlemen travel at an age
proper for them, during the course of their voyages,
their accounts to their friends, and after their return,
their discourses and conversations, will have in them
something above what we can meet with from those
who have not had those advantages. At the same time
it is to be observed, that every temper and genius is not
qualified for this way of improvement. Men may change
their climate, but they cannot their nature. A man that
goes out a fool, cannot ride or sail himself into common-sense.
Therefore let me but walk over London Bridge
with a young man, and I'll tell you infallibly whether
going over the Rialto at Venice will make him wiser.
It is not to be imagined how many I have saved in my
time from banishment, by letting their parents know they
were good for nothing. But this is to be done with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>much tenderness. There is my cousin Harry has a
son, who is the dullest mortal that was ever born into
our house. He had got his trunk and his books all
packed up to be transported into foreign parts, for no
reason but because the boy never talked; and his father
said he wanted to know the world. I could not say to
a fond parent, that the boy was dull; but looked grave,
and told him, the youth was very thoughtful, and I
feared he might have some doubts about religion, with
which it was not proper to go into Roman Catholic
countries. He is accordingly kept here till he declares
himself upon some points, which I am sure he will never
think of. By this means, I have prevented the dishonour
of having a fool of our house laughed at in all parts of
Europe. He is now with his father upon his own estate,
and he has sent to me to get him a wife, which I shall
do with all convenient speed; but it shall be such a one,
whose good nature shall hide his faults, and good sense
supply them. The truth of it is, that race is of the true
British kind: they are of our country only; it hurts
them to transplant them, and they are destroyed if you
pretend to improve them. Men of this solid make are
not to be hurried up and down the world, for (if I may
so speak) they are naturally at their wit's end; and it is
an impertinent part to disturb their repose, that they
may give you only a history of their bodily occurrences,
which is all they are capable of observing. Harry had
an elder brother who was tried in this way. I remember,
all he could talk of at his return, was, that he had like
to have been drowned at such a place, he fell out of a
chaise at another, he had a better stomach when he
moved northward than when he turned his course to the
parts in the south, and so forth. It is therefore very
much to be considered, what sense a person has of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
when he is setting out; and if he then knows none of
his friends and acquaintance but by their clothes and
faces, it is my humble opinion that he stay at home.
His parents should take care to marry him, and see what
they can get out of him that way; for there is a certain
sort of men who are no otherwise to be regarded, but as
they descend from men of consequence, and may beget
valuable successors. And if we consider, that men are
to be esteemed only as they are useful, while a stupid
wretch is at the head of a great family, we may say, the
race is suspended, as properly as when it is all gone, we
say, it is extinct."</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 11.</i><a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I had several hints and advertisements from unknown
hands, that some, who are enemies to my labours,
design to demand the fashionable way of satisfaction for
the disturbance my lucubrations have given them. I
confess, as things now stand, I don't know how to deny
such inviters, and am preparing myself accordingly: I
have bought pumps and foils, and am every morning
practising in my chamber. My neighbour, the dancing-master,
has demanded of me, why I take this liberty,
since I would not allow it him?<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> But I answered,
his was an act of an indifferent nature, and mine of
necessity. My late treatises against duels have so far
disobliged the fraternity of the noble science of defence,
that I can get none of them to show me as much as one
pass. I am therefore obliged to learn by book, and
have accordingly several volumes, wherein all the postures
are exactly delineated. I must confess, I am shy
of letting people see me at this exercise, because of my
flannel waistcoat, and my spectacles, which I am force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>d
to fix on, the better to observe the posture of the enemy.
I have upon my chamber walls, drawn at full length, the
figures of all sorts of men, from eight feet to three feet
two inches. Within this height I take it, that all the
fighting men of Great Britain are comprehended. But
as I push, I make allowances for my being of a lank and
spare body, and have chalked out in every figure my own
dimensions; for I scorn to rob any man of his life by
taking advantage of his breadth: therefore I press purely
in a line down from his nose, and take no more of him
to assault than he has of me: for to speak impartially,
if a lean fellow wounds a fat one in any part to the
right or left, whether it be in carte or in tierce, beyond
the dimensions of the said lean fellow's own breadth,
I take it to be murder, and such a murder as is below a
gentleman to commit. As I am spare, I am also very
tall, and behave myself with relation to that advantage
with the same punctilio; and I am ready to stoop or
stand, according to the stature of my adversary. I must
confess, I have had great success this morning, and have
hit every figure round the room in a mortal part,
without receiving the least hurt, except a little scratch
by falling on my face, in pushing at one at the lower
end of my chamber; but I recovered so quick, and
jumped so nimbly into my guard, that if he had been
alive he could not have hurt me. It is confessed, I
have written against duels with some warmth; but in
all my discourses, I have not ever said, that I knew how
a gentleman could avoid a duel if he were provoked to
it; and since that custom is now become a law, I know
nothing but the legislative power, with new animadversions
upon it, can put us in a capacity of denying
challenges, though we are afterwards hanged for it.
But no more of this at present. As things stand, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
shall put up no more affronts; and I shall be so far
from taking ill words, that I will not take ill looks.
I therefore warn all young hot fellows, not to look
hereafter more terrible than their neighbours; for if
they stare at me with their hats cocked higher than
other people, I won't bear it. Nay, I give warning to
all people in general to look kindly at me; for I'll bear
no frowns, even from ladies; and if any woman pretends
to look scornfully at me, I shall demand satisfaction of
the next of kin of the masculine gender.</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 14.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">That which we call gallantry to women seems to be
the heroic virtue of private persons; and there
never breathed one man, who did not, in that part of
his days wherein he was recommending himself to his
mistress, do something beyond his ordinary course of
life. As this has a very great effect even upon the most
slow and common men; so, upon such as it finds
qualified with virtue and merit, it shines out in proportionable
degrees of excellence: it gives new grace
to the most eminent accomplishments; and he who of
himself has either wit, wisdom, or valour, exerts each
of these noble endowments when he becomes a lover,
with a certain beauty of action above what was ever
observed in him before; and all who are without any
one of these qualities, are to be looked upon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
rabble of mankind. I was talking after this manner in
a corner of this place with an old acquaintance, who,
taking me by the hand, said, "Mr. Bickerstaff, your
discourse recalls to my mind a story, which I have
longed to tell you ever since I read that article wherein
you desire your friends to give you accounts of obscure
merit." The story I had of him is literally true, and
well known to be so in the country wherein the
circumstances were transacted. He acquainted me with
the names of the persons concerned, which I shall change
into feigned ones, there being a respect due to their
families, that are still in being, as well as that the names
themselves would not be so familiar to an English ear.
The adventure really happened in Denmark; and if I
can remember all the circumstances, I doubt not but it
will be as moving to my readers as it was to me.</p>

<p>Clarinda and Chloe, two very fine women, were bred
up as sisters in the family of Romeo, who was the father
of Chloe, and the guardian of Clarinda. Philander, a
young gentleman of a good person and charming conversation,
being a friend of old Romeo's, frequented his
house, and by that means was much in conversation with
the young ladies, though still in the presence of the
father and the guardian. The ladies both entertained a
secret passion for him, and could see well enough, notwithstanding
the delight which he really took in Romeo's
conversation, that there was something more in his heart
which made him so assiduous a visitant. Each of them
thought herself the happy woman; but the person
beloved was Chloe. It happened that both of them
were at a play on a carnival evening, when it is the
fashion there (as well as in most countries of Europe)
both for men and women to appear in masks and
disguises. It was on that memorable night in the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
1679, when the play-house, by some unhappy accident,
was set on fire.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Philander, in the first hurry of the
disaster, immediately ran where his treasure was, burst
open the door of the box, snatched the lady up in his
arms, and with unspeakable resolution and good fortune
carried her off safe. He was no sooner out of the crowd,
but he set her down; and grasping her in his arms, with
all the raptures of a deserving lover, "How happy am
I," says he, "in an opportunity to tell you I love you
more than all things, and of showing you the sincerity
of my passion at the very first declaration of it." "My
dear, dear Philander," says the lady, pulling off her
mask, "this is not a time for art; you are much dearer
to me than the life you have preserved: and the joy of
my present deliverance does not transport me so much
as the passion which occasioned it." Who can tell the
grief, the astonishment, the terror, that appeared in the
face of Philander, when he saw the person he spoke to
was Clarinda. After a short pause, "Madam," says he,
with the looks of a dead man, "we are both mistaken;"
and immediately flew away, without hearing the distressed
Clarinda, who had just strength enough to cry out,
"Cruel Philander! why did you not leave me in the
theatre?" Crowds of people immediately gathered
about her, and after having brought her to herself,
conveyed her to the house of the good old unhappy
Romeo. Philander was now pressing against a whole
tide of people at the doors of the theatre, and striving
to enter with more earnestness than any there endeavoured
to get out. He did it at last, and with much difficulty
forced his way to the box where his beloved Chloe stood,
expecting her fate amidst this scene of terror and distraction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>
<p>She revived at the sight of Philander, who
fell about her neck with a tenderness not to be expressed;
and amidst a thousand sobs and sighs, told her his love,
and his dreadful mistake. The stage was now in flames,
and the whole house full of smoke; the entrance was
quite barred up with heaps of people, who had fallen
upon one another as they endeavoured to get out;
swords were drawn, shrieks heard on all sides; and, in
short, no possibility of an escape for Philander himself,
had he been capable of making it without his Chloe.
But his mind was above such a thought, and wholly
employed in weeping, condoling, and comforting. He
catches her in his arms. The fire surrounds them,
while&mdash;I cannot go on.</p>

<p>Were I an infidel, misfortunes like this would convince
me, that there must be an hereafter: for who can
believe that so much virtue could meet with so great
distress without a following reward. As for my part, I
am so old-fashioned as firmly to believe that all who
perish in such generous enterprises are relieved from the
further exercise of life; and Providence, which sees their
virtue consummate and manifest, takes them to an immediate
reward, in a being more suitable to the grandeur of
their spirits. What else can wipe away our tears, when
we contemplate such undeserved, such irreparable distresses?
It was a sublime thought in some of the heathens
of old:</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 14.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">When I came home this evening, I found a present
from Mr. Charles Lillie, the perfumer at the corner of
Beauford Buildings, with a letter of thanks for the mention
I made of him.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> He tells me, several of my gentle
readers have obliged me in buying at his shop upon my
recommendation. I have inquired into the man's capacity,
and find him an adept in his way. He has several
helps to discourse besides snuff (which is the best Barcelona),
and sells an orange-flower water, which seems to
me to have in it the right spirit of brains; and I am informed,
he extracts it according to the manner used in
Gresham College.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> I recommend it to the handkerchiefs
of all young pleaders: it cures or supplies all pauses and
hesitations in speech, and creates a general alacrity of the
spirit. When it is used as a gargle, it gives volubility to
the tongue, and never fails of that necessary step towards
pleasing others, making a man pleased with himself. I
have taken security of him, that he shall not raise the
price of any of his commodities for these or any other
occult qualities in them; but he is to sell them at the
same price which you give at the common perfumers.
Mr. Lillie has brought further security, that he will not
sell the boxes made for politicians to lovers; nor on the
contrary, those proper for lovers to men of speculation:
at this time, to avoid confusion, the best orangery for
beaus, and right musty for politicians.</p>

<p>My almanac is to be published on the 22nd; and from
that instant, all lovers, in raptures or epistles, are to forbear
the comparison of their mistresses' eyes to stars, I
having made use of that simile in my dedication for the
last time it shall ever pass, and on the properest occasio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>n
that it was ever employed. All ladies are hereby desired
to take notice, that they never receive that simile in payment
for any smiles they shall bestow for the future.</p>

<p>On Saturday night last, a gentlewoman's husband strayed
from the play-house in the Haymarket. If the lady who
was seen to take him up, will restore him, she shall be
asked no questions, he being of no use but to the
owner.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 16.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There are several persons who have many pleasures
and entertainments in their possession which they
do not enjoy. It is therefore a kind and good office to
acquaint them with their own happiness, and turn their
attention to such instances of their good fortune which
they are apt to overlook. Persons in the married state
often want such a monitor, and pine away their days, by
looking upon the same condition in anguish and murmur
which carries with it in the opinion of others a complication
of all the pleasures of life, and a retreat from its
inquietudes. I am led into this thought by a visit I made
an old friend who was formerly my schoolfellow. He
came to town last week with his family for the winter,
and yesterday morning sent me word his wife expected
me to dinner. I am as it were at home at that house,
and every member of it knows me for their well-wisher.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
I cannot indeed express the pleasure it is, to be met by
the children with so much joy as I am when I go thither:
the boys and girls strive who shall come first, when they
think it is I that am knocking at the door; and that
child which loses the race to me, runs back again to tell
the father it is Mr. Bickerstaff. This day I was led in
by a pretty girl, that we all thought must have forgot
me; for the family has been out of town these two years.
Her knowing me again was a mighty subject with us, and
took up our discourse at the first entrance. After which
they began to rally me upon a thousand little stories they
heard in the country about my marriage to one of my
neighbour's daughters: upon which the gentleman my
friend said, "Nay, if Mr. Bickerstaff marries a child of
any of his old companions, I hope mine shall have the
preference; there's Mrs. Mary is now sixteen, and would
make him as fine a widow as the best of them: but I
know him too well; he is so enamoured with the very
memory of those who flourished in our youth, that he
will not so much as look upon the modern beauties. I
remember, old gentleman, how often you went home in
a day to refresh your countenance and dress, when Teraminta
reigned in your heart. As we came up in the
coach, I repeated to my wife some of your verses on her."
With such reflections on little passages which happened
long ago, we passed our time during a cheerful and
elegant meal. After dinner, his lady left the room, as
did also the children. As soon as we were alone, he
took me by the hand; "Well, my good friend," says he,
"I am heartily glad to see thee; I was afraid you would
never have seen all the company that dined with you
to-day again. Do not you think the good woman of the
house a little altered, since you followed her from the
play-house, to find out who she was, for me? I per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>ceived
a tear fall down his cheek as he spoke, which
moved me not a little. But to turn the discourse," said I,
"She is not indeed quite that creature she was when she
returned me the letter I carried from you; and told me,
she hoped, as I was a gentleman, I would be employed no
more to trouble her who had never offended me, but would
be so much the gentleman's friend as to dissuade him
from a pursuit which he could never succeed in. You
may remember, I thought her in earnest, and you were
forced to employ your cousin Will, who made his sister
get acquainted with her for you. You cannot expect her
to be for ever fifteen." "Fifteen?" replied my good
friend: "ah! you little understand, you that have lived
a bachelor, how great, how exquisite a pleasure there is
in being really beloved! It is impossible that the most
beauteous face in nature should raise in me such pleasing
ideas as when I look upon that excellent woman. That
fading in her countenance is chiefly caused by her watching
with me in my fever. This was followed by a fit of
sickness, which had like to have carried her off last winter.
I tell you sincerely, I have so many obligations to her,
that I cannot with any sort of moderation think of her
present state of health. But as to what you say of fifteen,
she gives me every day pleasures beyond what I ever knew
in the possession of her beauty when I was in the vigour
of youth. Every moment of her life brings me fresh
instances of her complacency to my inclinations, and her
prudence in regard to my fortune. Her face is to me
much more beautiful than when I first saw it; there is
no decay in any feature which I cannot trace from the
very instant it was occasioned by some anxious concern
for my welfare and interests. Thus at the same time,
methinks, the love I conceived towards her for what she
was, is heightened by my gratitude for what she is. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
love of a wife is as much above the idle passion commonly
called by that name, as the loud laughter of buffoons is
inferior to the elegant mirth of gentlemen. Oh! she is
an inestimable jewel. In her examination of her household
affairs, she shows a certain fearfulness to find a fault,
which makes her servants obey her like children; and
the meanest we have, has an ingenuous shame for an
offence, not always to be seen in children in other families.
I speak freely to you, my old friend; ever since her sickness,
things that gave me the quickest joy before, turn
now to a certain anxiety. As the children play in the
next room, I know the poor things by their steps, and
am considering what they must do, should they lose
their mother in their tender years. The pleasure I used
to take in telling my boy stories of the battles, and asking
my girl questions about the disposal of her baby,<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a>
and the gossiping of it, is turned into inward reflection
and melancholy." He would have gone on in this tender
way, when the good lady entered, and with an inexpressible
sweetness in her countenance told us, she had been
searching her closet for something very good to treat
such an old friend as I was. Her husband's eyes sparkled
with pleasure at the cheerfulness of her countenance;
and I saw all his fears vanish in an instant. The lad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>y
observing something in our looks which showed we had
been more serious than ordinary, and seeing her husband
receive her with great concern under a forced cheerfulness,
immediately guessed at what we had been talking of;
and applying herself to me, said, with a smile, "Mr.
Bickerstaff, don't believe a word of what he tells you.
I shall still live to have you for my second, as I have
often promised you, unless he takes more care of
himself than he has done since his coming to town.
You must know, he tells me, that he finds London is a
much more healthy place than the country; for he sees
several of his old acquaintance and school-fellows are
here, young fellows with fair<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> full-bottomed periwigs.
I could scarce keep him this morning from going out
open-breasted."<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> My friend, who is always extremely
delighted with her agreeable humour, made her sit down
with us. She did it with that easiness which is peculiar
to women of sense; and to keep up the good humour
she had brought in with her, turned her raillery upon
me. "Mr. Bickerstaff, you remember you followed me
one night from the play-house; supposing you should
carry me thither to-morrow night, and lead me into the
front box." This put us into a long field of discourse
about the beauties, who were mothers to the present, and
shone in the boxes twenty years ago. I told her, I was
glad she had transferred so many of her charms, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>did not question but her eldest daughter was within half
a year of being a toast.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> We were pleasing ourselves
with this fantastical preferment of the young lady, when
on a sudden we were alarmed with the noise of a drum,
and immediately entered my little godson to give me a
point of war.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> His mother, between laughing and chiding,
would have put him out of the room; but I would
not part with him so.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> I found, upon conversation with
him, though he was a little noisy in his mirth, that the
child had excellent parts, and was a great master of all
the learning on the other side eight years old. I perceived
him a very great historian in &AElig;sop's fables; but
he frankly declared to me his mind, that he did not
delight in that learning, because he did not believe they
were true; for which reason, I found he had very much
turned his studies, for about a twelvemonth past, into
the lives and adventures of Don Bellianis of Greece, Guy
of Warwick, the Seven Champions, and other historian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>s
of that age. I could not but observe the satisfaction the
father took in the forwardness of his son; and that these
diversions might turn to some profit, I found the boy
had made remarks, which might be of service to him
during the course of his whole life. He would tell you
the mismanagements of John Hickathrift,<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> find fault
with the passionate temper in Bevis of Southampton, and
loved St. George for being the champion of England;
and by this means, had his thoughts insensibly moulded
into the notions of discretion, virtue, and honour. I
was extolling his accomplishments, when the mother told
me, that the little girl who led me in this morning was
in her way a better scholar than he. "Betty," says she,
"deals chiefly in fairies and sprites; and sometimes in a
winter night, will terrify the maids with her accounts,
till they are afraid to go up to bed."</p>

<p>I sat with them till it was very late, sometimes in
merry, sometimes in serious discourse, with this particular
pleasure, which gives the only true relish to all conversation,
a sense that every one of us liked each other. I
went home, considering the different conditions of a
married life and that of a bachelor; and I must confess, it
struck me with a secret concern, to reflect, that whenever
I go off, I shall leave no traces behind me. In this pensive
mood I returned to my family; that is to say, to
my maid, my dog and my cat, who only can be the better
or worse for what happens to me.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 17.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It has cost me very much care and thought to marshal
and fix the people under their proper denominations,
and to range them according to their respective characters.
These my endeavours have been received with unexpected
success in one kind, but neglected in another;
for though I have many readers, I have but few converts.
This must certainly proceed from a false opinion, that
what I write is designed rather to amuse and entertain
than convince and instruct. I entered upon my essays
with a declaration, that I should consider mankind in
quite another manner than they had hitherto been represented
to the ordinary world; and asserted, that none but
a useful life should be with me any life at all. But lest
this doctrine should have made this small progress towards
the conviction of mankind because it may appear
to the unlearned light and whimsical, I must take leave
to unfold the wisdom and antiquity of my first proposition
in these my essays, to wit, that every worthless man is a
dead man. This notion is as old as Pythagoras, in whose
school it was a point of discipline, that if among the
&#7936;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#8055;, or probationers, there were any who grew wear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>y
of studying to be useful, and returned to an idle life, the
rest were to regard them as dead; and upon their departing,
to perform their obsequies, and raise them tombs,
with inscriptions, to warn others of the like mortality,
and quicken them to resolutions of refining their souls
above that wretched state. It is upon a like supposition
that young ladies at this very time in Roman Catholic
countries are received into some nunneries with their
coffins, and with the pomp of a formal funeral, to signify,
that henceforth they are to be of no further use,
and consequently dead. Nor was Pythagoras himself the
first author of this symbol, with whom, and with the
Hebrews, it was generally received. Much more might
be offered in illustration of this doctrine from sacred
authority, which I recommend to my reader's own reflection;
who will easily recollect, from places which I do
not think fit to quote here, the forcible manner of applying
the words dead and living to men as they are good
or bad.</p>

<p>I have therefore composed the following scheme of
existence for the benefit both of the living and the dead,
though chiefly for the latter, whom I must desire to read
it with all possible attention. In the number of the
dead, I comprehend all persons of what title or dignity
soever, who bestow most of their time in eating and drinking,
to support that imaginary existence of theirs, which
they call life; or in dressing and adorning those shadows
and apparitions which are looked upon by the vulgar as
real men and women. In short, whoever resides in the
world without having any business in it, and passes away
an age without ever thinking on the errand for which he
was sent hither, is to me a dead man to all intents and
purposes; and I desire that he may be so reputed. The
living are only those that are some way or other laudably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
employed in the improvement of their own minds, or for
the advantage of others; and even among these, I shall
only reckon into their lives that part of their time which
has been spent in the manner above mentioned. By these
means, I am afraid, we shall find the longest lives not to
consist of many months, and the greatest part of the earth
to be quite unpeopled. According to this system we may
observe, that some men are born at twenty years of age,
some at thirty, some at threescore, and some not above
an hour before they die; nay, we may observe multitudes
that die without ever being born, as well as many dead
persons that fill up the bulk of mankind, and make a
better figure in the eyes of the ignorant than those who
are alive and in their proper and full state of health.
However, since there may be many good subjects, that
pay their taxes, and live peaceably in their habitations,
who are not yet born, or have departed this life several
years since, my design is to encourage both to join themselves
as soon as possible to the number of the living:
for as I invite the former to break forth into being, and
become good for something; so I allow the latter a state
of resuscitation; which I chiefly mention for the sake of
a person who has lately published an advertisement, with
several scurrilous terms in it, that do by no means become
a dead man to give. It is my departed friend John Partridge,
who concludes the advertisement of his next year's
almanac<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> with the following note:</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>"Whereas it has been industriously given out by
Bickerstaff, Esq., and others, to prevent the sale of this
year's almanac, that John Partridge is dead: this may
inform all his loving countrymen, that he is still living,
in health, and they are knaves that reported it otherwise.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 18.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">When an engineer finds his guns have not had their
intended effect, he changes his batteries. I am
forced at present to take this method; and instead of
continuing to write against the singularity some are
guilty of in their habit and behaviour, I shall henceforward
desire them to persevere in it; and not only so,
but shall take it as a favour of all the coxcombs in the
town, if they will set marks upon themselves, and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>some particular in their dress, show to what class they
belong. It would be very obliging in all such persons,
who feel in themselves that they are not sound of understanding,
to give the world notice of it, and spare
mankind the pains of finding them out. A cane upon
the fifth button<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> shall from henceforth be the type
of a Dapper;<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> red-heeled shoes, and a hat hung upon
one side of the head, shall signify a Smart;<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> a good
periwig made into a twist, with a brisk cock, shall speak
a mettled fellow; and an upper lip covered with snuff,
denotes a coffee-house statesman. But as it is required
that all coxcombs hang out their signs, it is on the other
hand expected, that men of real merit should avoid
anything particular in their dress, gait, or behaviour.
For, as we old men delight in proverbs, I cannot forbear
bringing out one on this occasion, that "good wine
needs no bush."<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> I must not leave this subject without
reflecting on several persons I have lately met with, who
at a distance seem very terrible; but upon a stricter
inquiry into their looks and features, appeared as meek
and harmless as any of my own neighbours. These are
country gentlemen, who of late years have taken up
a humour of coming to town in red coats, whom an
arch wag of my acquaintance used to describe very well,
by calling them sheep in wolves' clothing. I have
often wondered, that honest gentlemen, who are good
neighbours, and live quietly in their own possessions,
should take it in their heads to frighten the town after
this unreasonable manner. I shall think myself obliged,
if they persist in so unnatural a dress (notwithstandin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>g
any posts they may have in the militia), to give away
their red coats to any of the soldiery who shall think
fit to strip them, provided the said soldiers can make
it appear, that they belong to a regiment where there
is a deficiency in the clothing.</p>

<p>About two days ago I was walking in the Park, and
accidentally met a rural squire, clothed in all the types
above mentioned, with a carriage and behaviour made
entirely out of his own head. He was of a bulk and
stature larger than ordinary, had a red coat, flung open
to show a gay calamanco<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> waistcoat: his periwig fell in
a very considerable bush upon each shoulder: his arms
naturally swung at an unreasonable distance from his
sides; which, with the advantage of a cane, that he
brandished in a great variety of irregular motions, made
it unsafe for any one to walk within several yards of him.
In this manner he took up the whole Mall, his spectators
moving on each side of it, whilst he cocked up his hat,
and marched directly for Westminster. I cannot tell
who this gentleman is, but for my comfort may say,
with the lover in Terence, who lost sight of a fine
young lady, "Wherever thou art, thou canst not be
long concealed."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_291" id="Footnote_291"></a><a href="#FNanchor_291"><span class="label">[291]</span></a> The "Partridge's Almanac" for 1710 was brought out by the
Stationers' Company, and not by Partridge. The following advertisement
appeared in No. 105 of the <i>Tatler</i>: "There having of late
in several newspapers been an advertisement of an almanac called
<i>Merlinus Liberatus</i>, pretended to be made by J. Partridge, but in truth
was patched together by Benjamin Harris, famous for practices of this
nature, this notice is given, to prevent persons from being imposed
upon; for there will not be any almanac published by J. Partridge
for the year 1710, the injunction granted by the Lord High Chancellor
against printing the same being still in force; and if any person
shall deal in any counterfeit almanacs, they will be proceeded against."
</p>
<p>
As Partridge is often mentioned in the <i>Tatler</i> (see Nos. 1, 7, 11, 56,
59, 67, 99, 216, 228, 240), it may be well to give some particulars of
him in addition to what is stated in the Introduction. Partridge was
born at East Sheen in 1644, and was apprenticed to a shoemaker;
but he studied assiduously, and, giving up his trade, began to publish
astrological books in 1678. His almanac, <i>Merlinus Liberatus</i>, appeared
first in 1680, and in 1682 he described himself as sworn physician to
Charles II. Afterwards he went to Leyden, and claimed to have received
the degree of M. D. During the closing years of the century
he had controversies with other almanac makers, and advertised quack
medicines. When Swift attacked him in 1708 he was rightly regarded
as being at the head of his profession. For a time he was silenced;
no almanac appeared from 1710 to 1713; but his <i>Merlinus Redivivus</i>
was issued in 1714, with an attack upon Swift. Partridge died at
Mortlake in 1715, and a monument to his memory was erected in the
churchyard. His will shows that he left property amounting to over
&pound;2000. It is said that his real name was Hewson.</p></div>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 21.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Having swept away prodigious multitudes in my last
paper, and brought a great destruction upon my
own species, I must endeavour in this to raise fresh
recruits, and, if possible, to supply the places of the
unborn and the deceased. It is said of Xerxes, that
when he stood upon a hill, and saw the whole country
round him covered with his army, he burst out in tears,
to think that not one of that multitude would be alive
a hundred years after. For my part, when I take a
survey of this populous city, I can scarce forbear
weeping, to see how few of its inhabitants are now living.
It was with this thought that I drew up my last bill of
mortality, and endeavoured to set out in it the great
number of persons who have perished by a distemper
(commonly known by the name of Idleness) which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
long raged in the world, and destroys more in every great
town than the plague has done at Dantzic.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> To repair
the mischief it has done, and stock the world with a
better race of mortals, I have more hopes of bringing to
life those that are young, than of reviving those that are
old. For which reason, I shall here set down that noble
allegory which was written by an old author called Prodicus,
but recommended and embellished by Socrates.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
It is the description of Virtue and Pleasure making their
court to Hercules under the appearances of two beautiful
women.</p>

<p>When Hercules, says the divine moralist, was in that
part of his youth in which it was natural for him to consider
what course of life he ought to pursue, he one day
retired into a desert, where the silence and solitude of
the place very much favoured his meditations. As he
was musing on his present condition, and very much
perplexed in himself on the state of life he should choose,
he saw two women of a larger stature than ordinary
approaching towards him. One of them had a very
noble air and graceful deportment; her beauty was
natural and easy, her person clean and unspotted, her
eyes cast towards the ground with an agreeable reserve,
her motion and behaviour full of modesty, and her raiment
as white as snow. The other had a great deal of health
and floridness in her countenance, which she had helped
with an artificial white and red, and endeavoured to
appear more graceful than ordinary in her mien, by a
mixture of affectation in all her gestures. She had a
wonderful confidence and assurance in her looks, and all
the variety of colours in her dress that she thought were
the most proper to show her complexion to an advantage.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>She cast her eyes upon herself, then turned them on
those that were present, to see how they liked her, and
often looked on the figure she made in her own shadow.
Upon her nearer approach to Hercules, she stepped before
the other lady (who came forward with a regular composed
carriage), and running up to him, accosted him
after the following manner:</p>

<p>"My dear Hercules," says she, "I find you are very
much divided in your own thoughts upon the way of
life that you ought to choose: be my friend, and follow
me; I'll lead you into the possession of pleasure, and
out of the reach of pain, and remove you from all the
noise and disquietude of business. The affairs of either
war or peace shall have no power to disturb you. Your
whole employment shall be to make your life easy, and
to entertain every sense with its proper gratification.
Sumptuous tables, beds of roses, clouds of perfumes,
concerts of music, crowds of beauties, are all in a readiness
to receive you. Come along with me into this
region of delights, this world of pleasure, and bid farewell
for ever to care, to pain, to business."</p>

<p>Hercules hearing the lady talk after this manner,
desired to know her name; to which she answered, "My
friends, and those who are well acquainted with me, call
me Happiness; but my enemies, and those who would
injure my reputation, have given me the name of Pleasure."</p>

<p>By this time the other lady was come up, who addressed
herself to the young hero in a very different
manner.</p>

<p>"Hercules," says she, "I offer myself to you, because
I know you are descended from the gods, and
give proofs of that descent by your love to virtue, and
application to the studies proper for your age. This
makes me hope you will gain both for yourself and me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
an immortal reputation. But before I invite you into
my society and friendship, I will be open and sincere
with you, and must lay down this as an established truth,
that there is nothing truly valuable which can be purchased
without pains and labour.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The gods have set
a price upon every real and noble pleasure. If you
would gain the favour of the Deity, you must be at the
pains of worshipping him; if the friendship of good
men, you must study to oblige them; if you would be
honoured by your country, you must take care to serve
it. In short, if you would be eminent in war or peace,
you must become master of all the qualifications that
can make you so. These are the only terms and
conditions upon which I can propose happiness." The
goddess of Pleasure here broke in upon her discourse:
"You see, "said she, "Hercules, by her own confession,
the way to her pleasures is long and difficult, whereas that
which I propose is short and easy." "Alas!" said the
other lady, whose visage glowed with a passion made
up of scorn and pity, "what are the pleasures you
propose? To eat before you are hungry, drink before
you are athirst, sleep before you are tired, to gratify
appetites before they are raised, and raise such appetites
as Nature never planted. You never heard the most
delicious music, which is the praise of one's self; nor
saw the most beautiful object, which is the work of one's
own hands. Your votaries pass away their youth in a
dream of mistaken pleasures, while they are hoarding
up anguish, torment, and remorse, for old age.</p>

<p>"As for me, I am the friend of gods and of good
men, an agreeable companion to the artisan, a household
guardian to the fathers of families, a patron and protector
of servants, an associate in all true and generou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>s
friendships. The banquets of my votaries are never
costly, but always delicious; for none eat or drink at
them who are not invited by hunger and thirst. Their
slumbers are sound, and their wakings cheerful. My
young men have the pleasure of hearing themselves
praised by those who are in years, and those who are in
years of being honoured by those who are young. In
a word, my followers are favoured by the gods, beloved
by their acquaintance, esteemed by their country, and
(after the close of their labours) honoured by posterity."</p>

<p>We know by the life of this memorable hero, to
which of these two ladies he gave up his heart; and
I believe, every one who reads this will do him the
justice to approve his choice.</p>

<p>I very much admire the speeches of these ladies, as
containing in them the chief arguments for a life of
virtue or a life of pleasure that could enter into the
thoughts of a heathen; but am particularly pleased with
the different figures he gives the two goddesses. Our
modern authors have represented Pleasure or Vice with
an alluring face, but ending in snakes and monsters:
here she appears in all the charms of beauty, though
they are all false and borrowed; and by that means,
composes a vision entirely natural and pleasing.</p>

<p>I have translated this allegory for the benefit of the
youth of Great Britain; and particularly of those who
are still in the deplorable state of non-existence, and
whom I most earnestly entreat to come into the world.
Let my embryos show the least inclination to any single
virtue, and I shall allow it to be a struggling towards
birth. I don't expect of them, that, like the hero in the
foregoing story, they should go about as soon as they are
born, with a club in their hands, and a lion's skin on their
shoulders, to root out monsters, and destroy tyrants; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
as the finest author of all antiquity has said upon this
very occasion, though a man has not the abilities to distinguish
himself in the most shining parts of a great
character, he has certainly the capacity of being just,
faithful, modest, and temperate.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 23.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I read the following letter, which was left for me this
evening, with very much concern for the lady's condition
who sent it, who expresses the state of her mind
with great frankness, as all people ought who talk to
their physicians.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Bickerstaff</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Though you are stricken in years, and have had great
experience in the world, I believe you will say, there
are not frequently such difficult occasions to act in with
decency as those wherein I am entangled. I am a woman
in love, and that you will allow to be the most unhappy
of all circumstances in human life: Nature has formed us
with a strong reluctance against owning such a passion,
and custom has made it criminal in us to make advances.
A gentleman, whom I will call Fabio, has the entire
possession of my heart. I am so intimately acquainted
with him, that he makes no scruple of communicating
to me an ardent affection he has for Cleora, a friend of
mine, who also makes me her confidante. Most part of
my life I am in company with the one or the other, and
am always entertained with his passion, or her triumph.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
Cleora is one of those ladies, who think they are virtuous,
if they are not guilty; and without any delicacy of choice,
resolves to take the best offer which shall be made to her.
With this prospect she puts off declaring herself in favour
of Fabio, till she sees what lovers will fall into her snares,
which she lays in all public places with all the art of
gesture and glances. This resolution she has herself told
me. Though I love him better than life, I would not
gain him by betraying Cleora, or committing such a
trespass against modesty as letting him know myself that
I love him. You are an astrologer, what shall I do?</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Diana Doubtful.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This lady has said very justly, that the condition of a
woman in love is of all others the most miserable. Poor
Diana! how must she be racked with jealousy when Fabio
talks of Cleora? how with indignation when Cleora makes
a property of Fabio? A female lover is in the condition
of a ghost, that wanders about its beloved treasure, without
power to speak until it is spoken to. I desire Diana
to continue in this circumstance; for I see an eye of
comfort in her case, and will take all proper measures to
extricate her out of this unhappy game of cross purposes.
Since Cleora is upon the catch with her charms, and has
no particular regard for Fabio, I shall place a couple of
special fellows in her way, who shall both address to her,
and have each a better estate than Fabio. They are both
already taken with her, and are preparing for being of
her retinue the ensuing winter. To women of this worldly
turn, as I apprehend Cleora to be, we must reckon backward
in our computation of merit; and when a fair lady
thinks only of making her spouse a convenient domestic,
the notion of worth and value is altered, and the lover is
the more acceptable the less he is considerable. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
I shall throw in the way of Cleora, are Orson Thickett
and Mr. Walter Wisdom. Orson is a huntsman, whose
father's death, and some difficulties about legacies, brought
out of the woods to town last November. He was at
that time one of those country savages who despise the
softness they meet in town and court, and professedly
show their strength and roughness in every motion and
gesture, in scorn of our bowing and cringing. He was
at his first appearance very remarkable for that piece of
good breeding peculiar to natural Britons, to wit, defiance.
He showed every one he met he was as good a
man as he. But in the midst of all his fierceness, he
would sometimes attend the discourse of a man of sense,
and look at the charms of a beauty with his eyes and
mouth open. He was in this posture when, in the beginning
of last December, he was shot by Cleora from a
side-box.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> From that moment he softened into humanity,
forgot his dogs and horses, and now moves and speaks
with civility and address. What Wisdom, by the death
of an elder brother, came to a great estate, when he had
proceeded just far enough in his studies to be very impertinent,
and at the years when the law gives him possession
of his fortune, and his own constitution is too
warm for the management of it. Orson is learning to
fence and dance, to please and fight for his mistress; and
Walter preparing fine horses, and a jingling chariot, to
enchant her. All persons concerned will appear at the
next opera, where will begin the wild-goose chase; and I
doubt, Fabio will see himself so overlooked for Orson or
Walter, as to turn his eyes on the modest passion and
becoming languor in the countenance of Diana; it being
my design to supply with the art of love all those who
preserve the sincere passion of it.</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 23.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">An ingenious and worthy gentleman, my ancient friend,<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
fell into discourse with me this evening upon the force
and efficacy which the writings of good poets have on the
minds of their intelligent readers, and recommended to
me his sense of the matter, thrown together in the following
manner, which he desired me to communicate to
the youth of Great Britain in my essays; which I choose
to do in his own words.</p>

<p>"I have always been of opinion," says he, "that virtue
sinks deepest into the heart of man when it comes recommended
by the powerful charms of poetry. The
most active principle in our mind is the imagination: to
it a good poet makes his court perpetually, and by this
faculty takes care to gain it first. Our passions and inclinations
come over next; and our reason surrenders
itself with pleasure in the end. Thus the whole soul is
insensibly betrayed into morality, by bribing the fancy
with beautiful and agreeable images of those very things
that in the books of the philosophers appear austere, and
have at the best but a kind of forbidden aspect. In a
word, the poets do, as it were, strew the rough paths of
virtue so full of flowers, that we are not sensible of the
uneasiness of them, and imagine ourselves in the midst of
pleasures, and the most bewitching allurements, at the time
we are making a progress in the severest duties of life.</p>

<p>"All then agree, that licentious poems do of all writings
soonest corrupt the heart: and why should we not be as
universally persuaded, that the grave and serious performances
of such as write in the most engaging manner,
by a kind of divine impulse, must be the most effectua<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>l
persuasives to goodness? If therefore I were blessed
with a son, in order to the forming of his manners
(which is making him truly my son) I should be
continually putting into his hand some fine poet. The
graceful sentences and the manly sentiments so frequently
to be met with in every great and sublime
writer, are, in my judgment, the most ornamental and
valuable furniture that can be for a young gentleman's
head; methinks they show like so much rich embroidery
upon the brain. Let me add to this, that humanity and
tenderness (without which there can be no true greatness
in the mind) are inspired by the Muses in such pathetical
language, that all we find in prose authors towards the
raising and improving of these passions, is in comparison
but cold, or lukewarm at the best. There is besides a
certain elevation of soul, a sedate magnanimity, and a
noble turn of virtue, that distinguishes the hero from
the plain, honest man, to which verse can only raise us.
The bold metaphors and sounding numbers, peculiar to
the poets, rouse up all our sleeping faculties, and alarm
the whole powers of the soul, much like that excellent
trumpeter mentioned by Virgil:</p>

</div></div>

<p>"I fell into this train of thinking this evening, upon
reading a passage in a masque written by Milton, where
two brothers are introduced seeking after their sister,
whom they had lost in a dark night and thick wood.

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Nov. 25.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have been this evening recollecting what passages
(since I could first think) have left the strongest
impressions upon my mind; and after strict inquiry, I
am convinced, that the impulses I have received fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>m
theatrical representations, have had a greater effect than
otherwise would have been wrought in me by the little
occurrences of my private life. My old friends, Hart<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
and Mohun,<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> the one by his natural and proper force,
the other by his great skill and art, never failed to send
me home full of such ideas as affected my behaviour,
and made me insensibly more courteous and humane to
my friends and acquaintance. It is not the business of a
good play to make every man a hero; but it certainly
gives him a livelier sense of virtue and merit than he had
when he entered the theatre. This rational pleasure (as
I always call it) has for many years been very little
tasted; but I am glad to find, that the true spirit of it
is reviving again amongst us, by a due regard to what is
presented, and by supporting only one play-house.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>t
has been within the observation of the youngest amongst
us, that while there were two houses, they did not outvie
each other by such representations as tended to the
instruction and ornament of life, but by introducing
mimical dances and fulsome buffooneries. For when an
excellent tragedy was to be acted in one house, the
ladder-dancer<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> carried the whole town to the other: and
indeed such an evil as this must be the natural consequence
of two theatres, as certainly as that there are
more who can see than can think. Every one is judge
of the danger of the fellow on the ladder, and his activity
in coming down safe; but very few are judges of the
distress of a hero in a play, or of his manner of behaviour
in those circumstances. Thus, to please the people, two
houses must entertain them with what they can understand,
and not with things which are designed to improve
their understanding: and the readiest way to gain good
audiences, must be to offer such things as are most
relished by the crowd; that is to say, immodest action,
empty show, or impertinent activity. In short, two
houses cannot hope to subsist, but by means which are
contradictory to the very institution of a theatre in a
well-governed kingdom.</p>

<p>I have ever had this sense of the thing, and for tha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>t
reason have rejoiced that my ancient coeval friend of
Drury Lane,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> though he had sold off most of his movables,
still kept possession of his palace, and trembled for
him, when he had lately like to have been taken by a
stratagem. There have for many ages been a certain
learned sort of unlearned men in this nation called
attorneys, who have taken upon them to solve all difficulties
by increasing them, and are called upon to the
assistance of all who are lazy, or weak of understanding.
The insolence of a ruler of this place made him resign
the possession of it to the management of my above-mentioned
friend Divito. Divito was too modest to know
when to resign it, till he had the opinion and sentence of
the law for his removal. Both these in length of time
were obtained against him: but as the great Archimedes
defended Syracuse with so powerful engines, that if he
threw a rope or piece of wood over the wall, the enemy
fled; so Divito had wounded all adversaries with so
much skill, that men feared even to be in the right against
him. For this reason, the lawful ruler sets up an attorney
to expel an attorney, and chose a name dreadful to
the stage,<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> who only seemed able to beat Divito out of
his entrenchments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 22nd instant, a night of public rejoicing, the
enemies of Divito made a largess to the people of faggots,
tubs, and other combustible matter, which was erected
into a bonfire before the palace. Plentiful cans were at
the same time distributed among the dependencies of
that principality; and the artful rival of Divito observing
them prepared for enterprise, presented the lawful
owner of the neighbouring edifice, and showed his deputation
under him. War immediately ensued upon the
peaceful empire of wit and the Muses; the Goths and
Vandals sacking Rome did not threaten a more barbarous
devastation of arts and sciences. But when they had
forced their entrance, the experienced Divito had detached
all his subjects, and evacuated all his stores. The neighbouring
inhabitants report, that the refuse of Divito's
followers marched off the night before disguised in magnificence;
door-keepers came out clad like cardinals, and
scene-drawers like heathen gods. Divito himself was
wrapped up in one of his black clouds, and left to the
enemy nothing but an empty stage, full of trap-doors,
known only to himself and his adherents.</p>


<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 25.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I have already taken great pains to inspire notions of
honour and virtue into the people of this kingdom,
and used all gentle methods imaginable, to bring those
who are dead in idleness, folly, and pleasure, into life, by
applying themselves to learning, wisdom, and industry.
But since fair means are ineffectual, I must proceed to
extremities, and shall give my good friends the Company
of Upholders full power to bury all such dead as they
meet with, who are within my former descriptions of
deceased persons. In the meantime the following remonstrance
of that corporation I take to be very just:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>


<h3><i>From our Office near the Haymarket, Nov. 23.</i></h3>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Worthy Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"Upon reading your <i>Tatler</i> of Saturday last,<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> by which
we received the agreeable news of so many deaths,
we immediately ordered in a considerable quantity of
blacks; and our servants have wrought night and day
ever since, to furnish out the necessaries for these deceased.
But so it is, Sir, that of this vast number of
dead bodies, that go putrefying up and down the streets,
not one of them has come to us to be buried. Though
we should be both to be any hindrance to our good friends
the physicians, yet we cannot but take notice, what infection
her Majesty's subjects are liable to from the horrible
stench of so many corpses. Sir, we will not detain you;
our case in short is this: here are we embarked, in this
undertaking for the public good: now if people shall be
suffered to go on unburied at this rate, there's an end of
the usefullest manufactures and handicrafts of the kingdom:
for where will be your sextons, coffin-makers, and
plumbers? What will become of your embalmers,
epitaph-mongers, and chief mourners? We are loth to
drive this matter any further, though we tremble at the
consequences of it: for if it shall be left to every dead
man's discretion not to be buried till he sees his time, no
man can say where that will end; but thus much we
will take upon us to affirm, that such a toleration will be
intolerable.</p>

<p>"What would make us easy in this matter, is no more
but that your Worship would be pleased to issue out your
orders to ditto dead to repair forthwith to our office, in
order to their interment, where constant attendance shall
be given to treat with all persons according to thei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>r
quality, and the poor to be buried for nothing; and for
the convenience of such persons as are willing enough to
be dead, but that they are afraid their friends and relations
should know it, we have a back door into Warwick
Street, from whence they may be interred with all secrecy
imaginable, and without loss of time, or hindrance of
business. But in case of obstinacy (for we would gladly
make a thorough riddance), we desire a further power
from your Worship, to take up such deceased as shall
not have complied with your first orders, wherever we
meet them; and if after that there shall be complaints
of any persons so offending, let them lie at our doors.&mdash;We
are,</p>

<p class="center">"Your Worship's till death,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Master and Company Of Upholders.</span></p>

<p>"<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;We are ready to give in our printed proposals
at large; and if your Worship approves of our undertaking,
we desire the following advertisement may be
inserted in your next paper:</p>

<p>"Whereas a commission of interment has been awarded
against Dr. John Partridge,<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> philomath, professor of physic
and astrology; and whereas the said Partridge hath not
surrendered himself, nor shown cause to the contrary, these
are to certify, that the Company of Upholders will proceed
to bury him from Cordwainers' Hall, on Tuesday
the 29th instant, where any six of his surviving friends,
who still believe him to be alive, are desired to come
prepared to hold up the pall.</p>

there being to be a sermon."</p></blockquote>

In 1705, Betterton's company moved to the new theatre in the Haymarket;
but the drama did not succeed at Vanbrugh's house, and in
1706 the Haymarket was let to M'Swiney. In 1708, through the
instrumentality of Colonel Brett, the actors were again reunited at
Drury Lane, and the Haymarket Theatre was devoted to Italian
operas. But Rich soon quarrelled with his company, some of whom
entered into negotiations with M'Swiney. In June 1709, Drury
Lane Theatre was closed by an order from the Lord Chamberlain,
and after certain structural alterations at the Haymarket, plays were
acted successfully at that house. For a time there was thus again
only one theatre open, until William Collier, M. P., a lawyer, got
for himself the licence refused to Rich, and entered into forcible
possession.</p></div>

<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Nov. 28.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was last week taking a solitary walk in the garden of
Lincoln's Inn (a favour that is indulged me by several
of the benchers who are my intimate friends, and grown
old with me in this neighbourhood), when, according to
the nature of men in years who have made but little
progress in the advancement of their fortune or their
fame, I was repining at the sudden rise of many persons
who are my juniors, and indeed at the unequal distribution
of wealth, honour, and all other blessings of life. I
was lost in this thought when the night came upon me,
and drew my mind into a far more agreeable contemplation.
The heaven above me appeared in all its glories,
and presented me with such a hemisphere of stars, as
made the most agreeable prospect imaginable to one who
delights in the study of nature. It happened to be a
freezing night, which had purified the whole body of air
into such a bright transparent &aelig;ther, as made every constellation
visible; and at the same time gave such a particular
glowing to the stars, that I thought it the richest
sky I had ever seen. I could not behold a scene so
wonderfully adorned and lighted up (if I may be allowed
that expression) without suitable meditations on the
Author of such illustrious and amazing objects. For on
these occasions, philosophy suggests motives to religion,
and religion adds pleasures to philosophy. As soon as I
had recovered my usual temper and serenity of soul, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
retired to my lodgings with the satisfaction of having
passed away a few hours in the proper employments of a
reasonable creature, and promising myself that my slumbers
would be sweet. I no sooner fell into them, but I dreamed
a dream, or saw a vision (for I know not which to call it),
that seemed to rise out of my evening meditation, and
had something in it so solemn and serious that I cannot
forbear communicating it; though I must confess, the
wildness of imagination (which in a dream is always loose
and irregular) discovers itself too much in several parts
of it. Methoughts I saw the same azure sky diversified
with the same glorious luminaries which had entertained
me a little before I fell asleep. I was looking very attentively
on that sign in the heavens which is called by the
name of the Balance, when on a sudden there appeared
in it an extraordinary light, as if the sun should rise at
midnight. By its increasing in breadth and lustre, I soon
found that it approached towards the earth; and at length
could discern something like a shadow hovering in the
midst of a great glory, which in a little time after I distinctly
perceived to be the figure of a woman. I fancied
at first it might have been the angel or intelligence that
guided the constellation from which it descended; but
upon a nearer view, I saw about her all the emblems with
which the goddess of Justice is usually described. Her
countenance was unspeakably awful and majestic, but
exquisitely beautiful to those whose eyes were strong
enough to behold it; her smiles transported with rapture,
her frowns terrified to despair. She held in her hand a
mirror, endowed with the same qualities as that which
the painters put into the hand of Truth. There streamed
from it a light, which distinguished itself from all the
splendours that surrounded her, more than a flash of
lightning shines in the midst of daylight. As she moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
it in her hand, it brightened the heavens, the air, or the
earth. When she had descended so low as to be seen and
heard by mortals, to make the pomp of her appearance
more supportable, she threw darkness and clouds about
her, that tempered the light into a thousand beautiful
shades and colours, and multiplied that lustre, which was
before too strong and dazzling, into a variety of milder
glories.</p>

<p>In the meantime the world was in an alarm, and all
the inhabitants of it gathered together upon a spacious
plain; so that I seemed to have the whole species before
my eyes. A voice was heard from the clouds, declaring
the intention of this visit, which was, to restore and appropriate
to every one living what was his due. The
fear and hope, joy and sorrow, which appeared in that
great assembly after this solemn declaration, are not to
be expressed. The first edict was then pronounced,
that all titles and claims to riches and estates, or to
any part of them, should be immediately vested in the
rightful owner. Upon this, the inhabitants of the earth
held up the instruments of their tenure, whether in parchment,
paper, wax, or any other form of conveyance; and
as the goddess moved the mirror of truth which she held
in her hand, so that the light which flowed from it fell
upon the multitude, they examined the several instruments
by the beams of it. The rays of this mirror had a particular
quality of setting fire to all forgery and falsehood.
The blaze of papers, the melting of seals, and crackling
of parchments made a very odd scene. The fire very
often ran through two or three lines only, and then
stopped. Though I could not but observe, that the
flame chiefly broke out among the interlineations and
codicils, the light of the mirror, as it was turned up and
down, pierced into all the dark corners and recesses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
the universe, and by that means detected many writings
and records which had been hidden or buried by time,
chance, or design. This occasioned a wonderful revolution
among the people. At the same time, the spoils of
extortion, fraud, and robbery, with all the fruits of
bribery and corruption, were thrown together into a
prodigious pile, that almost reached to the clouds, and
was called "the Mount of Restitution"; to which all
injured persons were invited to receive what belonged to
them.</p>

<p>One might see crowds of people in tattered garments
come up, and change clothes with others that were
dressed with lace and embroidery. Several who were
plumbs, or very near it, became men of moderate
fortunes; and many others, who were overgrown in
wealth and possessions, had no more left than what
they usually spent. What moved my concern most,
was, to see a certain street<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> of the greatest credit in
Europe from one end to the other become bankrupt.</p>

<p>The next command was, for the whole body of
mankind to separate themselves into their proper
families; which was no sooner done, but an edict was
issued out, requiring all children to repair to their true
and natural fathers. This put a great part of the
assembly in motion; for as the mirror was moved over
them, it inspired every one with such a natural instinct,
as directed them to their real parents. It was a very
melancholy spectacle to see the fathers of very large
families become childless, and bachelors undone by a
charge of sons and daughters. You might see a
presumptive heir of a great estate ask blessing of his
coachman, and a celebrated toast paying her duty to
a <i>valet de chambre</i>. Many under vows of celibac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>y
appeared surrounded with a numerous issue. This
change of parentage would have caused great lamentation,
but that the calamity was pretty common, and
that generally those who lost their children, had the
satisfaction of seeing them put into the hands of their
dearest friends. Men were no sooner settled in their
right to their possessions and their progeny, but there
was a third order proclaimed, that all the posts of
dignity and honour in the universe should be conferred
on persons of the greatest merit, abilities, and perfection.
The handsome, the strong, and the wealthy immediately
pressed forward; but not being able to bear the
splendour of the mirror which played upon their faces,
they immediately fell back among the crowd: but as
the goddess tried the multitude by her glass, as the
eagle does its young ones by the lustre of the sun, it
was remarkable, that every one turned away his face
from it who had not distinguished himself either by
virtue, knowledge, or capacity in business, either military
or civil. This select assembly was drawn up in the
centre of a prodigious multitude, which was diffused on
all sides, and stood observing them, as idle people use
to gather about a regiment that are exercising their
arms. They were drawn up in three bodies: in the
first were the men of virtue; in the second, men of
knowledge; and in the third, the men of business. It
was impossible to look at the first column without a
secret veneration, their aspects were so sweetened with
humanity, raised with contemplation, emboldened with
resolution, and adorned with the most agreeable airs,
which are those that proceed from secret habits of virtue.
I could not but take notice, that there were many faces
among them which were unknown, not only to the
multitude, but even to several of their own body.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>In the second column, consisting of the men of knowledge,
there had been great disputes before they fell into
the ranks, which they did not do at last without the
positive command of the goddess who presided over the
assembly. She had so ordered it, that men of the greatest
genius and strongest sense were placed at the head of the
column: behind these, were such as had formed their
minds very much on the thoughts and writings of others.
In the rear of the column were men who had more wit
than sense, or more learning than understanding. All
living authors of any value were ranged in one of these
classes; but I must confess, I was very much surprised
to see a great body of editors, critics, commentators, and
grammarians meet with so very ill a reception. They
had formed themselves into a body, and with a great deal
of arrogance demanded the first station in the column of
knowledge; but the goddess, instead of complying with
their request, clapped them all into liveries, and bade them
know themselves for no other but lackeys of the learned.</p>

<p>The third column were men of business, and consisting
of persons in military and civil capacities. The former
marched out from the rest, and placed themselves in the
front; at which the other shook their heads at them, but
did not think fit to dispute the post with them. I could
not but make several observations upon this last column
of people; but I have certain private reasons why I do
not think fit to communicate them to the public. In
order to fill up all the posts of honour, dignity, and
profit, there was a draught made out of each column of
men who were masters of all three qualifications in some
degree, and were preferred to stations of the first rank.
The second draught was made out of such as were possessed
of any two of the qualifications, who were disposed
of in stations of a second dignity. Those who were left,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
and were endowed only with one of them, had their
suitable posts. When this was over, there remained
many places of trust and profit unfilled, for which there
were fresh draughts made out of the surrounding multitude
who had any appearance of these excellences, or
were recommended by those who possessed them in
reality.</p>

<p>All were surprised to see so many new faces in the
most eminent dignities; and for my own part, I was very
well pleased to see that all my friends either kept their
present posts, or were advanced to higher.</p>

<p>Having filled my paper with those particulars of my
vision which concern the male part of mankind, I must
reserve for another occasion the sequel of it, which relates
to the fair sex.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Nov. 30.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The progress of my intended account of what happened
when Justice visited mortals, is at present
interrupted by the observation and sense of an injustice
against which there is no remedy, even in a kingdom
more happy in the care taken of the liberty and property
of the subject than any other nation upon earth. This
iniquity is committed by a most impregnable set o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>f
mortals, men who are rogues within the law; and in the
very commission of what they are guilty of, professedly
own, that they forbear no injury but from the terror of
being punished for it. These miscreants are a set of
wretches we authors call pirates, who print any book,
poem, or sermon, as soon as it appears in the world, in
a smaller volume, and sell it (as all other thieves do
stolen goods) at a cheaper rate.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> I was in my rage
calling them rascals, plunderers, robbers, highwaymen.
But they acknowledge all that, and are pleased with
those, as well as any other titles; nay, will print them
themselves to turn the penny. I am extremely at a loss
how to act against such open enemies, who have not
shame enough to be touched with our reproaches, and
are as well defended against what we can say as what
we can do. Railing therefore we must turn int<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>o
complaint, which I cannot forbear making, when I
consider that all the labours of my long life may be
disappointed by the first man that pleases to rob me.
I had flattered myself, that my stock of learning was
worth &pound;150 per annum, which would very handsomely
maintain me and my little family, who are so happy or
so wise as to want only necessaries. Before men had
come up to this bare-faced impudence, it was an estate
to have a competency of understanding. An ingenious
droll, who is since dead (and indeed it is well for him
he is so, for he must have starved had he lived to this
day), used to give me an account of his good husbandry
in the management of his learning. He was a general
dealer, and had his "Amusements" as well comical as
serious. The merry rogue said, when he wanted a dinner he
wrote a paragraph of table-talk, and his bookseller upon
sight paid the reckoning. He was a very good judge of
what would please the people, and could aptly hit both
the genius of his readers and the season of the year in
his writings. His brain, which was his estate, had
as regular and different produce as other men's land.
From the beginning of November till the opening of
the campaign, he wrote pamphlets and letters to members
of Parliament, or friends in the country; but sometimes
he would relieve his ordinary readers with a murder, and
lived comfortably a week or two upon strange and
lamentable accidents. A little before the armies took
the field, his way was to open your attention with a
prodigy; and a monster well written, was two guineas
the lowest price. This prepared his readers for his great
and bloody news from Flanders in June and July. Poor
Tom!<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> he is gone. But I observed, he always looke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>d
well after a battle, and was apparently fatter in a fighting
year. Had this honest careless fellow lived till now,
famine had stared him in the face, and interrupted his
merriment, as it must be a solid affliction to all those
whose pen is their portion. As for my part, I do not
speak wholly for my own sake on this point; for
palmistry and astrology will bring me in greater gains
than these my papers; so that I am only in the condition
of a lawyer who leaves the bar for chamber practice.
However, I may be allowed to speak in the cause of
learning itself, and lament, that a liberal education is the
only one which a polite nation makes unprofitable.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> All
mechanic artisans are allowed to reap the fruit of their
invention and ingenuity without invasion; but he that
has separated himself from the rest of mankind, and
studied the wonders of the creation, the government of
his passions, and the revolutions of the world, and has
an ambition to communicate the effect of half his life
spent in such noble inquiries, has no property in what
he is willing to produce, but is exposed to robbery and
want, with this melancholy and just reflection, that he i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>s
the only man who is not protected by his country, at the
same time that he best deserves it. According to the
ordinary rules of computation, the greater the adventure
is, the greater ought to be the profit of those who succeed
in it; and by this measure, none have pretence of turning
their labours to greater advantage than persons brought
up to letters. A learned education, passing through
great schools and universities, is very expensive, and consumes
a moderate fortune, before it is gone through in
its proper forms. The purchase of an handsome commission
or employment, which would give a man a good
figure in another kind of life, is to be made at a much
cheaper rate. Now, if we consider this expensive voyage
which is undertaken in the search of knowledge, and how
few there are who take in any considerable merchandise,
how less frequent it is to be able to turn what men have
gained into profit? How hard is it, that the very small
number who are distinguished with abilities to know how
to vend their wares, and have the good fortune to bring
them into port, should suffer being plundered by privateers
under the very cannon that should protect them? The
most eminent and useful author of the age we live in,
after having laid out a princely revenue in works of charity
and beneficence, as became the greatness of his mind, and
the sanctity of his character, would have left the person
in the world who was the dearest to him in a narrow condition,
had not the sale of his immortal writings brought
her in a very considerable dowry; though it was impossible
for it to be equal to their value. Every one will know
that I here mean the works of the late Archbishop of
Canterbury,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> the copy of which was sold for &pound;2500.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>
<p>I do not speak with relation to any party; but it has
happened, and may often so happen, that men of great
learning and virtue cannot qualify themselves for being
employed in business, or receiving preferments. In this
case, you cut them off from all support if you take from
them the benefit that may arise from their writings. For
my own part, I have brought myself to consider things in
so unprejudiced a manner, that I esteem more a man who
can live by the products of his understanding, than one
who does it by the favour of great men.</p>

<p>The zeal of an author has transported me thus far,
though I think myself as much concerned in the capacity of
a reader. If this practice goes on, we must never expect
to see again a beautiful edition of a book in Great Britain.</p>

<p>We have already seen the Memoirs of Sir William
Temple<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> published in the same character and volume
with the history of Tom Thumb, and the works of our
greatest poets shrunk into penny books and garlands.
For my own part, I expect to see my lucubrations printed
on browner paper<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> than they are at present; and, if the
humour continues, must be forced to retrench my expensive
way of living, and not smoke above two pipes
a day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Charles Lillie, perfumer at the corner of Beauford
Buildings, has informed me, that I am obliged to several
of my customers for coming to his shop upon my recommendation;
and has also given me further assurances
of his upright dealing with all who shall be so kin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>d
as to make use of my name to him. I acknowledge this
favour, and have, for the service of my friends who frequent
his shop, used the force of magical powers to add
value to his wares. By my knowledge in the secret operations
of nature, I have made his powders, perfumed and
plain, have the same effect as love-powder to all who are
too much enamoured to do more than dress at their mistresses.
His amber orange-flower, musk, and civet-violet,
put only into a handkerchief, shall have the same effect
towards an honourable lover's wishes as if he had been
wrapped in his mother's smock. Wash-balls perfumed,
camphored, and plain, shall restore complexions to that
degree, that a country fox-hunter who uses them shall in
a week's time look with a courtly and affable paleness,
without using the bagnio or cupping. <i>N. B.</i>&mdash;Mr. Lillie
has snuffs, Barcelona, Seville, musty, plain, and Spanish,
which may be taken by a young beginner without danger
of sneezing.</p>


<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Nov. 30.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Whereas several walking-dead persons arrived within
the bills of mortality, before and since the 15th
instant, having been informed of my warrant<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> given to the
Company of Upholders, and being terrified thereat (it not
having been advertised that privilege or protection would
be allowed), have resolved forthwith to retire to their
several and respective abodes in the country, hoping
thereby to elude any commission of interment that may
issue out against them; and being informed of such their
fallacious designs, I do hereby give notice, as well for the
good of the public as for the great veneration I have for
the before-mentioned useful society, that a process is
gone out against them, and that, in case of contempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>,
they may be found or heard of at most coffee-houses in
and about Westminster.</p>

<p>I must desire my readers to help me out from time
to time in the correction of these my essays; for as
a shaking hand does not always write legibly, the press
sometimes prints one word for another; and when my
paper is to be revised, I am perhaps so busy in observing
the spots of the moon, that I have not time to find out
the <i>errata</i> that are crept into my lucubrations.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">A Continuation of the Vision.</span><a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></h4>

<p class="drop-cap">The male world were dismissed by the goddess of
Justice, and disappeared, when on a sudden the
whole plain was covered with women. So charming a
multitude filled my heart with unspeakable pleasure;
and as the celestial light of the mirror shone upon their
faces, several of them seemed rather persons that descended
in the train of the goddess, than such who were
brought before her to their trial. The clack of tongues,
and confusion of voices, in this new assembly, was so
very great, that the goddess was forced to command
silence several times, and with some severity before she
could make them attentive to her edicts. They were all
sensible that the most important affair among womankind
was then to be settled, which every one knows
to be the point of place. This had raised innumerabl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>e
disputes among them, and put the whole sex into a
tumult. Every one produced her claim, and pleaded her
pretensions. Birth, beauty, wit, or wealth, were words
that rung in my ears from all parts of the plain. Some
boasted of the merit of their husbands; others of their
own power in governing them. Some pleaded their
unspotted virginity; others their numerous issue. Some
valued themselves as they were the mothers, and others
as they were the daughters, of considerable persons.
There was not a single accomplishment unmentioned or
unpractised. The whole congregation was full of singing,
dancing, tossing, ogling, squeaking, smiling, sighing,
fanning, frowning, and all those irresistible arts which
women put in practice to captivate the hearts of reasonable
creatures. The goddess, to end this dispute, caused
it to be proclaimed, that every one should take place
according as she was more or less beautiful. This declaration
gave great satisfaction to the whole assembly,
which immediately bridled up, and appeared in all its
beauties. Such as believed themselves graceful in their
motion, found an occasion of falling back, advancing
forward, or making a false step, that they might show
their persons in the most becoming air. Such as had
fine necks and bosoms, were wonderfully curious to look
over the heads of the multitude, and observe the most
distant parts of the assembly. Several clapped their
hands on their foreheads, as helping their sight to look
upon the glories that surrounded the goddess, but in
reality to show fine hands and arms. The ladies were
yet better pleased, when they heard, that in the decision
of this great controversy, each of them should be her
own judge, and take her place according to her own
opinion of herself, when she consulted her looking-glass.</p>

<p>The goddess then let down the mirror of truth in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
golden chain, which appeared larger in proportion as it
descended and approached nearer to the eyes of the beholders.
It was the particular property of this looking-glass
to banish all false appearances, and show people
what they are. The whole woman was represented,
without regard to the usual external features, which were
made entirely conformable to their real characters. In
short, the most accomplished (taking in the whole circle
of female perfections) were the most beautiful; and the
most defective, the most deformed. The goddess so varied
the motion of the glass, and placed it in so many different
lights, that each had an opportunity of seeing herself in it.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the rage, the pleasure, or
astonishment, that appeared in each face upon its representation
in the mirror: multitudes started at their own
form, and would have broken the glass if they could have
reached it. Many saw their blooming features wither as
they looked upon them, and their self-admiration turned
into a loathing and abhorrence. The lady who was
thought so agreeable in her anger, and was so often celebrated
for a woman of fire and spirit, was frightened at
her own image, and fancied she saw a fury in the glass.
The interested mistress beheld a harpy, and the subtle
jilt a sphinx. I was very much troubled in my own
heart to see such a destruction of fine faces; but at the
same time had the pleasure of seeing several improved,
which I had before looked upon as the greatest masterpieces
of nature. I observed, that some few were so
humble as to be surprised at their own charms; and that
many a one who had lived in the retirement and severity
of a vestal, shone forth in all the graces and attractions
of a siren. I was ravished at the sight of a particular
image in the mirror, which I think the most beautiful
object that my eyes ever beheld. There was something
more than human in her countenance: her eyes were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
full of light, that they seemed to beautify everything
they looked upon. Her face was enlivened with such a
florid bloom, as did not so properly seem the mark of
health as of immortality. Her shape, her stature, and
her mien were such as distinguished her even there where
the whole fair sex was assembled.</p>

<p>I was impatient to see the lady represented by so divine
an image, whom I found to be the person that stood at
my right hand, and in the same point of view with myself.
This was a little old woman, who in her prime had been
about five feet high, though at present shrunk to about
three-quarters of that measure; her natural aspect was
puckered up with wrinkles, and her head covered with
grey hairs. I had observed all along an innocent cheerfulness
in her face, which was now heightened into rapture
as she beheld herself in the glass. It was an odd circumstance
in my dream (but I cannot forbear relating it): I
conceived so great an inclination towards her, that I had
thoughts of discoursing her upon the point of marriage,
when on a sudden she was carried from me; for the word
was now given, that all who were pleased with their own
images, should separate, and place themselves at the head
of their sex.</p>

<p>This detachment was afterwards divided into three
bodies, consisting of maids, wives, and widows; the wives
being placed in the middle, with the maids on the right,
and widows on the left; though it was with difficulty
that these two last bodies were hindered from falling
into the centre. This separation of those who liked
their real selves not having lessened the number of the
main body so considerably as it might have been wished,
the goddess, after having drawn up her mirror, thought
fit to make new distinctions among those who did not
like the figure which they saw in it. She made several
wholesome edicts, which have slipped out of my mind;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
but there were two which dwelt upon me, as being very
extraordinary in their kind, and executed with great
severity. Their design was to make an example of two
extremes in the female world: of those who are very
severe on the conduct of others, and of those who are
very regardless of their own. The first sentence, therefore,
the goddess pronounced, was, that all females
addicted to censoriousness and detraction should lose the
use of speech; a punishment which would be the most
grievous to the offender, and (what should be the end
of all punishments) effectual for rooting out the crime.
Upon this edict, which was as soon executed as published,
the noise of the assembly very considerably abated. It
was a melancholy spectacle, to see so many who had the
reputation of rigid virtue struck dumb. A lady who
stood by me, and saw my concern, told me, she wondered
I could be concerned for such a pack of&mdash;I found, by
the shaking of her head, she was going to give me their
characters; but by her saying no more, I perceived she
had lost the command of her tongue. This calamity fell
very heavy upon that part of women who are distinguished
by the name of prudes, a courtly word for female hypocrites,
who have a short way to being virtuous, by showing
that others are vicious. The second sentence was
then pronounced against the loose part of the sex, that
all should immediately be pregnant who in any part of
their lives had run the hazard of it. This produced a
very goodly appearance, and revealed so many misconducts,
that made those who were lately struck dumb,
repine more than ever at their want of utterance; though,
at the same time (as afflictions seldom come single), many
of the mutes were also seized with this new calamity.
The ladies were now in such a condition, that they would
have wanted room, had not the plain been large enough
to let them divide their ground, and extend their lines on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
all sides. It was a sensible affliction to me to see such a
multitude of fair ones either dumb or big-bellied. But
I was something more at ease when I found that they
agreed upon several regulations to cover such misfortunes:
among others, that it should be an established
maxim in all nations, that a woman's first child might
come into the world within six months after her acquaintance
with her husband; and that grief might retard the
birth of her last till fourteen months after his decease.</p>

<p>This vision lasted till my usual hour of waking, which
I did with some surprise, to find myself alone, after having
been engaged almost a whole night in so prodigious a
multitude. I could not but reflect with wonder at the
partiality and extravagance of my vision; which according
to my thoughts, has not done justice to the sex. If
virtue in men is more venerable, it is in women more
lovely; which Milton has very finely expressed in his
"Paradise Lost," where Adam, speaking of Eve, after
having asserted his own pre-eminence, as being first in
creation and internal faculties, breaks out into the following
rapture:</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Dec. 5.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There is nothing gives a man greater satisfaction than
the sense of having despatched a great deal of business,
especially when it turns to the public emolument.
I have much pleasure of this kind upon my spirits at
present, occasioned by the fatigue of affairs which I went
through last Saturday. It is some time since I set apart
that day for examining the pretensions of several who
had applied to me for canes, perspective-glasses, snuff-boxes,
orange-flower waters, and the like ornaments of
life. In order to adjust this matter, I had before directed
Charles Lillie of Beauford Buildings to prepare a great
bundle of blank licences in the following words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You are hereby required to permit the bearer of this
cane to pass and repass through the streets and suburbs
of London, or any place within ten miles of it, without
let or molestation; provided that he does not walk with
it under his arm, brandish it in the air, or hang it on a
button: in which case it shall be forfeited; and I hereby
declare it forfeited to any one who shall think it safe to
take it from him.</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff.</span>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>
<p>The same form, differing only in the provisos, will
serve for a perspective, snuff-box, or perfumed handkerchief.
I had placed myself in my elbow-chair at the
upper end of my great parlour, having ordered Charles
Lillie to take his place upon a joint-stool with a writing-desk
before him. John Morphew<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> also took his station
at the door; I having, for his good and faithful services,
appointed him my chamber-keeper upon court-days. He
let me know, that there were a great number attending
without. Upon which, I ordered him to give notice,
that I did not intend to sit upon snuff-boxes that day;
but that those who appeared for canes might enter. The
first presented me with the following petition, which I
ordered Mr. Lillie to read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"To <span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff</span>, Esq., Censor of Great Britain.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>The humble Petition of Simon Trippit</i>:</p>

<p>"Sheweth&mdash;That your petitioner having been bred up
to a cane from his youth, it is now become as necessary
to him as any other of his limbs.</p>

<p>"That a great part of his behaviour depending upon
it, he should be reduced to the utmost necessities if he
should lose the use of it.</p>

<p>"That the knocking of it upon his shoe, leaning one
leg upon it, or whistling with it on his mouth, are such
great reliefs to him in conversation, that he does not
know how to be good company without it.</p>

<p>"That he is at present engaged in an amour, and must
despair of success, if it be taken from him.</p>

<p>"Your petitioner therefore hopes, that (the premises
tenderly considered) your Worship will not deprive him
of so useful and so necessary a support.</p>

<p>"/*
And your petitioner shall ever, &amp;c."
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>
<p>Upon the hearing of his case, I was touched with
some compassion, and the more so when upon observing
him nearer I found he was a prig. I bade him produce
his cane in court, which he had left at the door. He
did so, and I finding it to be very curiously clouded, with a
transparent amber head, and a blue ribbon to hang upon
his wrist,<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> I immediately ordered my clerk Lillie to lay
it up, and deliver out to him a plain joint headed with
walnut; and then, in order to wean him from it by
degrees, permitted him to wear it three days in a week,
and to abate proportionably till he found himself able
to go alone.</p>

<p>The second who appeared, came limping into the
court: and setting forth in his petition many pretences
for the use of a cane, I caused them to be examined one
by one; but finding him in different stories, and confronting
him with several witnesses who had seen him
walk upright, I ordered Mr. Lillie to take in his cane,
and rejected his petition as frivolous.</p>

<p>A third made his entry with great difficulty, leaning
upon a slight stick, and in danger of falling every step
he took. I saw the weakness of his hams; and hearing
that he had married a young wife about a fortnight
before, I bade him leave his cane, and gave him a new
pair of crutches, with which he went off in great vigour
and alacrity. This gentleman was succeeded by another,
who seemed very much pleased while his petition was
reading, in which he had represented, that he was
extremely afflicted with the gout, and set his foot
upon the ground with the caution and dignity which
accompany that distemper. I suspected him for an
impostor, and having ordered him to be searched, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>committed him into the hands of Dr. Thomas Smith,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
in King Street (my own corn-cutter), who attended in
an outward room, and wrought so speedy a cure upon
him, that I thought fit to send him also away without
his cane.</p>

<p>While I was thus dispensing justice, I heard a noise in
my outward room; and inquiring what was the occasion
of it, my door-keeper told me, that they had taken up
one in the very fact as he was passing by my door.
They immediately brought in a lively fresh-coloured
young man, who made great resistance with hand an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>d
foot, but did not offer to make use of his cane, which
hung upon his fifth button. Upon examination, I found
him to be an Oxford scholar, who was just entered at
the Temple. He at first disputed the jurisdiction of the
court; but being driven out of his little law and logic,
he told me very pertly, that he looked upon such a
perpendicular creature as man to make a very imperfect
figure without a cane in his hand. "It is well known,"
says he, "we ought, according to the natural situation of
our bodies, to walk upon our hands and feet; and that
the wisdom of the ancients had described man to be an
animal of four legs in the morning, two at noon, and
three at night; by which they intimated, that a cane
might very properly become part of us in some period of
life." Upon which I asked him, whether he wore it at
his breast to have it in readiness when that period should
arrive? My young lawyer immediately told me, he had
a property in it, and a right to hang it where he pleased,
and to make use of it as he thought fit, provided that he
did not break the peace with it: and further said, that
he never took it off his button, unless it were to lift it
up at a coachman, hold it over the head of a drawer,
point out the circumstances of a story, or for other
services of the like nature, that are all within the laws of
the land. I did not care for discouraging a young man
who, I saw, would come to good; and because his heart
was set upon his new purchase, I only ordered him to
wear it about his neck, instead of hanging it upon his
button, and so dismissed him. There were several
appeared in court whose pretensions I found to be very
good, and therefore gave them their licences upon paying
their fees; as many others had their licences renewed
who required more time for recovery of their lameness
than I had before allowed them.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>Having despatched this set of my petitioners, there
came in a well-dressed man, with a glass tube in one
hand, and his petition in the other. Upon his entering
the room, he threw back the right side of his wig, put
forward his right leg, and advancing the glass to his
right eye, aimed it directly at me. In the meanwhile, to
make my observations also, I put on my spectacles; in
which posture we surveyed each other for some time.
Upon the removal of our glasses, I desired him to read
his petition, which he did very promptly and easily;
though at the same time it set forth, that he could see
nothing distinctly, and was within very few degrees of
being utterly blind; concluding with a prayer, that he
might be permitted to strengthen and extend his sight
by a glass. In answer to this I told him, he might
sometimes extend it to his own destruction. "As you
are now," said I, "you are out of the reach of beauty;
the shafts of the finest eyes lose their force before they
can come at you; you can't distinguish a toast from an
orange-wench; you can see a whole circle of beauty
without any interruption from an impertinent face to
discompose you. In short, what are snares for others&mdash;"
My petitioner would hear no more, but told me very
seriously, "Mr. Bickerstaff, you quite mistake your man;
it is the joy, the pleasure, the employment of my
life, to frequent public assemblies, and gaze upon the
fair." In a word, I found his use of a glass was occasioned
by no other infirmity but his vanity, and was not
so much designed to make him see, as to make him be
seen and distinguished by others. I therefore refused
him a licence for a perspective, but allowed him a pair
of spectacles, with full permission to use them in any
public assembly as he should think fit. He was followed
by so very few of this order of men, that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
reason to hope this sort of cheats are almost at an
end.</p>

<p>The orange-flower men appeared next with petitions,
perfumed so strongly with musk, that I was almost overcome
with the scent; and for my own sake was obliged
forthwith to license their handkerchiefs, especially when
I found they had sweetened them at Charles Lillie's, and
that some of their persons would not be altogether
inoffensive without them. John Morphew, whom I have
made the general of my dead men, acquainted me, that
the petitioners were all of that order, and could produce
certificates to prove it if I required it. I was so well
pleased with this way of their embalming themselves,
that I commanded the above-said Morphew to give it in
orders to his whole army, that every one who did not
surrender himself up to be disposed of by the Upholders
should use the same method to keep himself sweet
during his present state of putrefaction.</p>

<p>I finished my session with great content of mind, reflecting
upon the good I had done; for however slightly
men may regard these particularities and little follies in
dress and behaviour, they lead to greater evils. The
bearing to be laughed at for such singularities, teach us
insensibly an impertinent fortitude, and enable us to bear
public censure for things which more substantially deserve
it. By this means they open a gate to folly, and oftentimes
render a man so ridiculous as to discredit his
virtues and capacities, and unqualify them from doing
any good in the world. Besides, the giving into uncommon
habits of this nature is a want of that humble
deference which is due to mankind, and (what is worst
of all) the certain indication of some secret flaw in the
mind of the person that commits them. When I was a
young man, I remember a gentleman of great integrity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
and worth was very remarkable for wearing a broad belt,
and a hanger instead of a fashionable sword, though in
all other points a very well-bred man. I suspected him
at first sight to have something wrong in him, but was
not able for a long while to discover any collateral proofs
of it. I watched him narrowly for six-and-thirty years,
when at last, to the surprise of everybody but myself,
who had long expected to see the folly break out, he
married his own cook-maid.</p>

<h3><i>From my own Apartment, Dec. 7.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">My brother Tranquillus being gone out of town for
some days, my sister Jenny sent me word she
would come and dine with me, and therefore desired me
to have no other company. I took care accordingly, and
was not a little pleased to see her enter the room with a
decent and matron-like behaviour, which I thought very
much became her. I saw she had a great deal to say to
me, and easily discovered in her eyes, and the air of her
countenance, that she had abundance of satisfaction in
her heart, which she longed to communicate. However,
I was resolved to let her break into her discourse her own
way, and reduced her to a thousand little devices and
intimations to bring me to the mention of her husband.
But finding I was resolved not to name him, she began of
her own accord. "My husband," said she, "gives his
humble service to you;" to which I only answered, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
hope he is well," and without waiting for a reply, fell into
other subjects. She at last was out of all patience, and
said (with a smile and manner that I thought had more
beauty and spirit than I had ever observed before in her),
"I did not think, brother, you had been so ill-natured.
You have seen, ever since I came in, that I had a mind to
talk of my husband, and you won't be so kind as to give
me an occasion." "I did not know," said I, "but it
might be a disagreeable subject to you. You do not
take me for so old-fashioned a fellow as to think of
entertaining a young lady with the discourse of her husband.
I know, nothing is more acceptable than to speak
of one who is to be so; but to speak of one who is so!
Indeed, Jenny, I am a better bred man than you think
me." She showed a little dislike at my raillery; and by
her bridling up, I perceived she expected to be treated
hereafter not as Jenny Distaff, but Mrs. Tranquillus. I
was very well pleased with this change in her humour;
and upon talking with her on several subjects, I could
not but fancy that I saw a great deal of her husband's
way and manner in her remarks, her phrases, the tone of her
voice, and the very air of her countenance. This gave me
an unspeakable satisfaction, not only because I had found
her a husband, from whom she could learn many things
that were laudable, but also because I looked upon her
imitation of him as an infallible sign that she entirely
loved him. This is an observation that I never knew
fail, though I do not remember that any other has made
it. The natural shyness of her sex hindered her from
telling me the greatness of her own passion; but I easily
collected it, from the representation she gave me of his.
"I have everything," says she, "in Tranquillus that I can
wish for; and enjoy in him (what indeed you have told
me were to be met with in a good husband) the fondness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
of a lover, the tenderness of a parent, and the intimacy
of a friend." It transported me to see her eyes swimming
in tears of affection when she spoke. "And is there not,
dear sister," said I, "more pleasure in the possession of
such a man than in all the little impertinences of balls,
assemblies, and equipage, which it cost me so much pains
to make you contemn?" She answered, smiling, "Tranquillus
has made me a sincere convert in a few weeks,
though I am afraid you could not have done it in your
whole life. To tell you truly, I have only one fear hanging
upon me, which is apt to give me trouble in the
midst of all my satisfactions: I am afraid, you must
know, that I shall not always make the same amiable
appearance in his eye that I do at present. You know,
brother Bickerstaff, that you have the reputation of a
conjurer; and if you have any one secret in your art to
make your sister always beautiful, I should be happier
than if I were mistress of all the worlds you have shown
me in a starry night." "Jenny," said I, "without having
recourse to magic, I shall give you one plain rule, that
will not fail of making you always amiable to a man who
has so great a passion for you, and is of so equal and
reasonable a temper as Tranquillus. Endeavour to please,
and you must please; be always in the same disposition
as you are when you ask for this secret, and, you may
take my word, you will never want it. An inviolable
fidelity, good humour, and complacency of temper outlive
all the charms of a fine face, and make the decays of
it invisible."</p>

<p>We discoursed very long upon this head, which was
equally agreeable to us both; for I must confess (as I
tenderly love her), I take as much pleasure in giving
her instructions for her welfare as she herself does in
receiving them. I proceeded therefore to inculcate these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
sentiments, by relating a very particular passage that
happened within my own knowledge.</p>

<p>There were several of us making merry at a friend's
house in a country village, when the sexton of the
parish church entered the room in a sort of surprise,
and told us, that as he was digging a grave in the
chancel, a little blow of his pick-axe opened a decayed
coffin, in which there were several written papers. Our
curiosity was immediately raised, so that we went to the
place where the sexton had been at work, and found
a great concourse of people about the grave. Among
the rest, there was an old woman, who told us, the
person buried there was a lady, whose name I do not
think fit to mention, though there is nothing in the
story but what tends very much to her honour<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>. This
lady lived several years an exemplary pattern of conjugal
love, and dying soon after her husband, who every way
answered her character in virtue and affection, made it
her death-bed request, that all the letters which she had
received from him, both before and after her marriage,
should be buried in the coffin with her. These I found
upon examination were the papers before us. Several
of them had suffered so much by time, that I could only
pick out a few words; as, "My soul!" "Lilies!"
"Roses!" "Dearest angel!" and the like. One of
them (which was legible throughout) ran thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"If you would know the greatness of my love, consider
that of your own beauty. That blooming
countenance, that snowy bosom, that graceful person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>,
return every moment to my imagination: the brightness
of your eyes hath hindered me from closing mine since
I last saw you. You may still add to your beauties by
a smile. A frown will make me the most wretched of
men, as I am the most passionate of lovers."</p></blockquote>

<p>It filled the whole company with a deep melancholy,
to compare the description of the letter with the person
that occasioned it, who was now reduced to a few
crumbling bones, and a little mouldering heap of earth.
With much ado I deciphered another letter, which begun
with "My dear, dear wife." This gave me a curiosity
to see how the style of one written in marriage differed
from one written in courtship. To my surprise, I found
the fondness rather augmented than lessened, though the
panegyric turned upon a different accomplishment. The
words were as follow:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap">"Before this short absence from you, I did not know
that I loved you so much as I really do; though
at the same time, I thought I loved you as much as
possible. I am under great apprehensions, lest you
should have any uneasiness whilst I am defrauded of my
share in it, and can't think of tasting any pleasures that
you don't partake with me. Pray, my dear, be careful
of your health, if for no other reason because you
know I could not outlive you. It is natural in absence
to make professions of an inviolable constancy; but
towards so much merit, it is scarce a virtue, especially
when it is but a bare return to that of which you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>given me such continued proofs ever since our first
acquaintance.</p>

<p class="right">"I am, &amp;c."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It happened that the daughter of these two excellent
persons was by when I was reading this letter. At the
sight of the coffin, in which was the body of her mother,
near that of her father, she melted into a flood of tears.
As I had heard a great character of her virtue, and
observed in her this instance of filial piety, I could not
resist my natural inclination of giving advice to young
people, and therefore addressed myself to her: "Young
lady," said I, "you see how short is the possession of
that beauty in which Nature has been so liberal to
you. You find the melancholy sight before you, is a
contradiction to the first letter that you heard on that
subject; whereas you may observe, the second letter,
which celebrates your mother's constancy, is itself, being
found in this place, an argument of it. But, Madam,
I ought to caution you, not to think the bodies that lie
before you, your father and your mother. Know their
constancy is rewarded by a nobler union than by this
mingling of their ashes, in a state where there is no
danger or possibility of a second separation."</p>

<p class="drop-cap">As soon as my midnight studies are finished, I take
but a very short repose, and am again up at an
exercise of another kind; that is to say, my fencing.
Thus my life passes away in a restless pursuit of fame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>

<p>This may serve for a preface to the history of poor

much made for happiness, and a quiet life, as any one
breathing; but has been lately entangled in so many
intricate and unreasonable distresses, as would have made
him (had he been a man of too nice honour) the most
wretched of all mortals. I came to the knowledge of
his affairs by mere accident. Several of the narrow end
of our lane having made an appointment to visit some
friends beyond St. Katherine's<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>, where there was to be a
merry meeting, they would needs take with them the old
gentleman, as they are pleased to call me. I, who value
my company by their good-will, which naturally has the
same effect as good-breeding, was not too stately, or too
wise, to accept of the invitation. Our design was to be
spectators of a sea-ball; to which I readily consented,
provided I might be <i>incognito</i>, being naturally pleased
with the survey of human life in all its degrees and circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to this merriment, Will Rosin
(who is the Corelli<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> of the Wapping side, as Tom Scrape
is the Bononcini<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> of Redriffe) was immediately sent for;
but to our utter disappointment, poor Will was under
an arrest, and desired the assistance of all his kind masters
and mistresses, or he must go to gaol. The whole company
received his message with great humanity, and very
generously threw in their halfpence apiece in a great dish,
which purchased his redemption out of the hands of the
bailiffs. During the negotiation for his enlargement, I
had an opportunity of acquainting myself with his history.</p>

<p>Mr. William Rosin, of the parish of St. Katherine, is
somewhat stricken in years, and married to a young
widow, who has very much the ascendant over him:
this degenerate age being so perverted in all things, that
even in the state of matrimony the young pretend to
govern their elders. The musician is extremely fond of
her; but is often obliged to lay by his fiddle to hear
louder notes of hers, when she is pleased to be angry
with him: for you are to know, Will is not of consequence
enough to enjoy her conversation but when she
chides him, or makes use of him to carry on her amours.
For she is a woman of stratagem; and even in that part
of the world where one would expect but very little
gallantry, by the force of natural genius, she can be
sullen, sick, out of humour, splenetic, want new clothes,
and more money, as well as if she had been bred in
Cheapside or Cornhill. She was lately under a secret
discontent upon account of a lover she was like to los<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>e
by his marriage: for her gallant, Mr. Ezekiel Boniface,
had been twice asked in church, in order to be joined in
matrimony with Mrs. Winifred Dimple, spinster, of the
same parish. Hereupon Mrs. Rosin was far gone in
that distemper which well-governed husbands know by
the description of, "I am I know not how;" and Will
soon understood, that it was his part to inquire into the
occasion of her melancholy, or suffer as the cause of it
himself. After much importunity, all he could get out
of her, was, that she was the most unhappy and the
most wicked of all women, and had no friend in the
world to tell her grief to. Upon this, Will doubled
his importunities; but she said that she should break
her poor heart, if he did not take a solemn oath upon a
Book, that he would not be angry; and that he would
expose the person who had wronged her to all the world,
for the ease of her mind, which was no way else to be
quieted. The fiddler was so melted, that he immediately
kissed her, and afterwards the Book. When
his oath was taken, she began to lament herself, and
revealed to him, that (miserable woman as she was) she
had been false to his bed. Will was glad to hear it
was no worse; but before he could reply, "Nay," said
she, "I will make you all the atonement I can, and take
shame upon me by proclaiming it to all the world, which
is the only thing that can remove my present terrors of
mind." This was indeed too true; for her design was
to prevent Mr. Boniface's marriage, which was all she
apprehended. Will was thoroughly angry, and began to
curse and swear, the ordinary expressions of passion in
persons of his condition. Upon which his wife&mdash;"Ah
William! how well you mind the oath you have taken,
and the distress of your poor wife, who can keep nothing
from you; I hope you won't be such a perjured wretch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
as to forswear yourself." The fiddler answered, that his
oath obliged him only not to be angry at what was past;
"but I find you intend to make me laughed at all
over Wapping." "No, no," replied Mrs. Rosin, "I see
well enough what you would be at, you poor-spirited
cuckold&mdash;you are afraid to expose Boniface, who has
abused your poor wife, and would fain persuade me still
to suffer the stings of conscience; but I assure you,
sirrah, I won't go to the devil for you." Poor Will
was not made for contention, and beseeching her to be
pacified, desired she would consult the good of her soul
her own way, for he would not say her nay in anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosin was so very loud and public in her invectives
against Boniface, that the parents of his mistress
forbade the banns, and his match was prevented, which
was the whole design of this deep stratagem. The
father of Boniface brought his action of defamation,
arrested the fiddler, and recovered damages. This was
the distress from which he was relieved by the company;
and the good husband's air, history, and jollity, upon
his enlargement, gave occasion to very much mirth;
especially when Will, finding he had friends to stand
by him, proclaimed himself a cuckold by way of insult
over the family of the Bonifaces. Here is a man of
tranquillity without reading Seneca! What work had
such an incident made among persons of distinction?
The brothers and kindred of each side must have been
drawn out, and hereditary hatreds entailed on the families
as long as their very names remained in the world.
Who would believe that Herod, Othello, and Will Rosin
were of the same species?</p>

<p>There are quite different sentiments which reign in
the parlour and the kitchen; and it is by the point of
honour, when justly regulated and inviolably observed,
that some men are superior to others, as much as man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>kind
in general are to brutes. This puts me in mind of
a passage in the admirable poem called the "Dispensary,"<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>
where the nature of true honour is artfully described in
an ironical dispraise of it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>But e'er we once engage in honour's cause,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>First know what honour is, and whence it was.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Scorned by the base, 'tis courted by the brave,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The hero's tyrant, and the coward's slave.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Born in the noisy camp, it lives on air;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And both exists by hope and by despair.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Angry whene'er a moment's ease we gain,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And reconciled at our returns of pain.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>It lives when in death's arms the hero lies;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>But when his safety he consults, it dies.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Bigoted to this idol, we disclaim</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Rest, health, and ease, for nothing but a name.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A very old fellow visited me to-day at my lodgings,
and desired encouragement and recommendation from
me for a new invention of knockers to doors, which he
told me he had made, and professed to teach rustic servants
the use of them. I desired him to show me an
experiment of this invention; upon which he fixed one
of his knockers to my parlour door. He then gave me
a complete set of knocks, from the solitary rap of the
dun and beggar to the thunderings of the saucy footman
of quality, with several flourishes and rattlings never yet
performed. He likewise played over some private notes,
distinguishing the familiar friend or relation from the
most modish visitor; and directing when the reserve
candles are to be lighted. He has several other curiosities
in this art. He waits only to receive my approbation
of the main design. He is now ready to practise to such
as shall apply themselves to him; but I have put off his
public licence till next court day.</p>

<p><i>N. B.</i>&mdash;He teaches underground.</p>

<h3><i>Will's Coffee-house, Dec. 12.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was this evening sitting at the side-table, and reading
one of my own papers with great satisfaction, not
knowing that I was observed by any in the room. I had
not long enjoyed this secret pleasure of an author, when
a gentleman, some of whose works I have been highly
entertained with,<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> accosted me after the following manner:
"Mr. Bickerstaff, you know I have for some years devoted
myself wholly to the Muses, and perhaps you will be
surprised when I tell you I am resolved to take up and
apply myself to business: I shall therefore beg you will
stand my friend, and recommend a customer to me for
several goods that I have now upon my hands." I desired
him to let me have a particular, and I would do my
utmost to serve him. "I have first of all," says he, "the
progress of an amour digested into sonnets, beginning
with a poem to the unknown fair, and ending with an
epithalamium. I have celebrated in it, her cruelty, her
pity, her face, her shape, her wit, her good-humour, her
dancing, her singing&mdash;" I could not forbear interruptin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>g
him: "This is a most accomplished lady," said I; "but
has she really, with all these perfections, a fine voice?"
"Pugh," says he, "you do not believe there is such a person
in nature. This was only my employment in solitude
last summer, when I had neither friends nor books to
divert me." "I was going," says I, "to ask her name,
but I find it is only an imaginary mistress." "That's
true," replied my friend, "but her name is Flavia. I
have," continued he, "in the second place, a collection
of lampoons, calculated either for the Bath, Tunbridge,
or any place where they drink waters, with blank spaces
for the names of such person or persons as may be inserted
in them on occasion. Thus much I have told only of
what I have by me proceeding from love and malice. I
have also at this time the sketch of an heroic poem upon
the next peace:<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> several indeed of the verses are either
too long or too short, it being a rough draught of my
thoughts upon that subject." I thereupon told him, that
as it was, it might probably pass for a very good Pindaric,
and I believed I knew one who would be willing
to deal with him for it upon that foot. "I must tell you
also, I have made a dedication to it, which is about four
sides close written, that may serve any one that is tall,
and understands Latin. I have further, about fifty
similes that were never yet applied, besides three-and-twenty
descriptions of the sun rising, that might be of
great use to an epic poet. These are my more bulky
commodities: besides which, I have several small-wares
that I would part with at easy rates; as, observations upon
life, and moral sentences, reduced into several couplets,
very proper to close up acts of plays, and may be easily
introduced by two or three lines of prose, either in tragedy
or comedy. If I could find a purchaser curious in Lati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>n
poetry, I could accommodate him with two dozen of
epigrams, which, by reason of a few false quantities,
should come for little or nothing."</p>

<p>I heard the gentleman with much attention, and asked
him, whether he would break bulk, and sell his goods by
retail, or designed they should all go in a lump? He
told me, that he should be very loth to part them, unless
it was to oblige a man of quality, or any person for whom
I had a particular friendship. "My reason for asking,"
said I, "is, only because I know a young gentleman who
intends to appear next spring in a new jingling chariot,
with the figures of the nine Muses on each side of it;
and I believe, would be glad to come into the world in
verse." We could not go on in our treaty, by reason of
two or three critics that joined us. They had been talking,
it seems, of the two letters which were found in the
coffin, and mentioned in one of my late lucubrations,<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> and
came with a request to me, that I would communicate
any others of them that were legible. One of the gentlemen
was pleased to say, that it was a very proper instance
of a widow's constancy; and said, he wished I had subjoined,
as a foil to it, the following passage in "Hamlet."
The young Prince was not yet acquainted with all the
guilt of his mother, but turns his thoughts on her sudden
forgetfulness of his father, and the indecency of her hasty
marriage.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>She married&mdash;O most wicked speed! to post</i><br /></span>

<p>The several emotions of mind, and breaks of passion,
in this speech, are admirable. He has touched every
circumstance that aggravated the fact, and seemed
capable of hurrying the thoughts of a son into distraction.
His father's tenderness for his mother, expressed
in so delicate a particular; his mother's fondness for
his father, no less exquisitely described; the great and
amiable figure of his dead parent drawn by a true filial
piety; his disdain of so unworthy a successor to his
bed; but above all, the shortness of the time between
his father's death and his mother's second marriage,
brought together with so much disorder, make up as
noble a part as any in that celebrated tragedy. The
circumstance of time I never could enough admire.
The widowhood had lasted two months&mdash;this is his first
reflection: but as his indignation rises, he sinks to
scarce two months: afterwards into a month; and at
last, into a little month. But all this so naturally, that
the reader accompanies him in the violence of his passion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>,
and finds the time lessen insensibly, according to the
different workings of his disdain. I have not mentioned
the incest of her marriage, which is so obvious a provocation;
but cannot forbear taking notice, that when
his fury is at its height, he cries, "Frailty, thy name is
woman!" as railing at the sex in general, rather than
giving himself leave to think his mother worse than
others.&mdash;<i>Desiderantur multa.</i></p>

<p>Whereas Mr. Jeffery Groggram has surrendered himself
by his letter bearing date December 7, and has sent an
acknowledgment that he is dead, praying an order to the
Company of Upholders for interment at such a reasonable
rate as may not impoverish his heirs: the said
Groggram having been dead ever since he was born, and
added nothing to his small patrimony, Mr. Bickerstaff
has taken the premises into consideration; and being
sensible of the ingenuous and singular behaviour of this
petitioner, pronounces the said Jeffery Groggram a live
man, and will not suffer that he should bury himself out
of modesty; but requires him to remain among the
living, as an example to those obstinate dead men, who
will neither labour for life, nor go to their grave.</p>

<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Dec. 14.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">About four this afternoon, which is the hour I usually
put myself in readiness to receive company, there
entered a gentleman who I believed at first came upon
some ordinary question; but as he approached nearer to
me, I saw in his countenance a deep sorrow, mixed with
a certain ingenuous complacency that gave me a sudden
good-will towards him. He stared, and betrayed an
absence of thought as he was going to communicate his
business to me. But at last, recovering himself, he said,
with an air of great respect, "Sir, it would be an injury
to your knowledge in the occult sciences, to tell you what
is my distress; I dare say, you read it in my countenance:
I therefore beg your advice to the most unhappy of all
men." Much experience has made me particularly sagacious
in the discovery of distempers, and I soon saw that
his was love. I then turned to my commonplace book,
and found his case under the word "coquette"; and
reading over the catalogue which I have collected out of
this great city of all under that character, I saw at the
name of Cynthia his fit came upon him. I repeated
the name thrice after a musing manner, and immediately
perceived his pulse quicken two-thirds; when his eyes,
instead of the wildness with which they appeared at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
entrance, looked with all the gentleness imaginable upon
me, not without tears. "O sir!" said he, "you know
not the unworthy usage I have met with from the woman
my soul dotes on. I could gaze at her to the end of my
being; yet when I have done so, for some time past I
have found her eyes fixed on another. She is now two-and-twenty,
in the full tyranny of her charms, which she
once acknowledged she rejoiced in, only as they made her
choice of me, out of a crowd of admirers, the more obliging.
But in the midst of this happiness, so it is, Mr.
Bickerstaff, that young Quicksett, who is just come to
town, without any other recommendation than that of
being tolerably handsome, and excessively rich, has won
her heart in so shameless a manner, that she dies for him.
In a word, I would consult you, how to cure myself of
this passion for an ungrateful woman, who triumphs in her
falsehood, and can make no man happy, because her own
satisfaction consists chiefly in being capable of giving distress.
I know Quicksett is at present considerable with
her for no other reason but that he can be without her, and
feel no pain in the loss. Let me therefore desire you, sir,
to fortify my reason against the levity of an inconstant,
who ought only to be treated with neglect." All this
time I was looking over my receipts, and asked him if
he had any good winter boots. "Boots, sir!" said my
patient. I went on: "You may easily reach Harwich in
a day, so as to be there when the packet goes off." "Sir,"
said the lover, "I find you design me for travelling; but
alas! I have no language; it will be the same thing to me
as solitude, to be in a strange country. I have," continued
he, sighing, "been many years in love with this
creature, and have almost lost even my English, at least
to speak such as anybody else does. I asked a tenant of
ours, who came up to town the other day with rent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
whether the flowery mead near my father's house in the
country had any shepherd in it. I have called a cave a
grotto these three years, and must keep ordinary company,
and frequent busy people for some time, before I
can recover my common words." I smiled at his raillery
upon himself, though I well saw it came from a heavy
heart. "You are," said I, "acquainted, to be sure, with
some of the general officers; suppose you made a campaign?"
"If I did," said he, "I should venture more
than any man there, for I should be in danger of starving;
my father is such an untoward old gentleman, that he
would tell me he found it hard enough to pay his taxes
towards the war, without making it more expensive by
an allowance to me. With all this, he is as fond as he is
rugged, and I am his only son."</p>

<p>I looked upon the young gentleman with much tenderness,
and not like a physician, but a friend; for I talked
to him so largely, that if I had parcelled my discourse
into distinct prescriptions, I am confident I gave him two
hundred pounds' worth of advice. He heard me with
great attention, bowing, smiling, and showing all other
instances of that natural good-breeding which ingenuous
tempers pay to those who are elder and wiser than themselves.
I entertained him to the following purpose. "I
am sorry, sir, that your passion is of so long a date, for
evils are much more curable in their beginnings; but at
the same time must allow, that you are not to be blamed,
since your youth and merit has been abused by one of the
most charming, but the most unworthy, sort of women,
the coquettes. A coquette is a chaste jilt, and differs only
from a common one, as a soldier, who is perfect in exercise,
does from one that is actually in service. This grief,
like all other, is to be cured only by time; and although
you are convinced this moment, as much as you will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
ten years hence, that she ought to be scorned and neglected,
you see you must not expect your remedy from
the force of reason. The cure then is only in time, and
the hastening of the cure only in the manner of employing
that time. You have answered me as to travel and a
campaign, so that we have only Great Britain to avoid
her in. Be then yourself, and listen to the following
rules, which only can be of use to you in this unaccountable
distemper, wherein the patient is often averse even
to his recovery. It has been of benefit to some to apply
themselves to business; but as that may not lie in your
way, go down to your estate, mind your fox-hounds, and
venture the life you are weary of over every hedge and
ditch in the country. These are wholesome remedies;
but if you can have resolution enough, rather stay in
town, and recover yourself even in the town where she
inhabits. Take particular care to avoid all places where
you may possibly meet her, and shun the sight of everything
which may bring her to your remembrance; there
is an infection in all that relates to her: you'll find, her
house, her chariot, her domestics, and her very lap-dog,
are so many instruments of torment. Tell me seriously,
do you think you could bear the sight of her fan?" He
shook his head at the question, and said, "Ah! Mr.
Bickerstaff, you must have been a patient, or you could
not have been so good a physician." "To tell you truly,"
said I, "about the thirtieth year of my age, I received a
wound that has still left a scar in my mind, never to be
quite worn out by time or philosophy.</p>

<p>"The means which I found the most effectual for my
cure, were reflections upon the ill-usage I had received
from the woman I loved, and the pleasure I saw her take
in my sufferings.</p>

<p>"I considered the distress she brought upon me the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
greatest that could befall a human creature, at the
same time that she did not inflict this upon one who was
her enemy, one that had done her an injury, one that
had wished her ill; but on the man who loved her more
than any else loved her, and more than it was possible
for him to love any other person.</p>

<p>"In the next place, I took pains to consider her in
all her imperfections; and that I might be sure to
hear of them constantly, kept company with those her
female friends who were her dearest and most intimate
acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Among her highest imperfections, I still dwelt upon
her baseness of mind and ingratitude, that made her
triumph in the pain and anguish of the man who loved
her, and of one who in those days (without vanity be it
spoken) was thought to deserve her love.</p>

<p>"To shorten my story, she was married to another,
which would have distracted me had he proved a good
husband; but to my great pleasure, he used her at first
with coldness, and afterwards with contempt. I hear he
still treats her very ill; and am informed, that she often
says to her woman, 'This is a just revenge for my falsehood
to my first love: what a wretch am I, that might
have been married to the famous Mr. Bickerstaff.'"</p>

<p>My patient looked upon me with a kind of melancholy
pleasure, and told me, he did not think it was
possible for a man to live to the age I now am of, who
in his thirtieth year had been tortured with that passion
in its violence. "For my part," said he, "I can neither
eat, drink, nor sleep in it; nor keep company with anybody,
but two or three friends who are in the same
condition."</p>

<p>"There," answered I, "you are to blame; for as you
ought to avoid nothing more than keeping company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
with yourself, so you ought to be particularly cautious
of keeping company with men like yourself. As long
as you do this, you do but indulge your distemper.</p>

<p>"I must not dismiss you without further instructions.
If possible, transfer your passion from the woman you
are now in love with, to another; or if you cannot do
that, change the passion itself into some other passion;
that is, to speak more plainly, find out some other
agreeable woman:<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> or if you can't do this, grow covetous,
ambitious, litigious; turn your love of woman into that
of profit, preferment, reputation; and for a time, give
up yourself entirely to the pursuit.</p>

<p>"This is a method we sometimes take in physic, when
we turn a desperate disease into one we can more easily
cure."</p>

<p>He made little answer to all this, but crying out,
"Ah, sir!" for his passion reduced his discourse to
interjections.</p>

<p>"There is one thing added, which is present death to
a man in your condition, and therefore to be avoided
with the greatest care and caution: that is, in a word,
to think of your mistress and rival together, whether
walking, discoursing, dallying&mdash;" "The devil!" he
cried out, "who can bear it?" To compose him, for I
pitied him very much, "The time will come," said I,
"when you shall not only bear it, but laugh at it. As
a preparation to it, ride every morning an hour at leas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>t
with the wind full in your face. Upon your return,
recollect the several precepts which I have now given
you, and drink upon them a bottle of spa-water.
Repeat this every day for a month successively, and let
me see you at the end of it." He was taking his leave,
with many thanks, and some appearance of consolation
in his countenance, when I called him back to acquaint
him, that I had private information of a design of the
coquettes to buy up all the true spa-water in town;
upon which he took his leave in haste, with a resolution
to get all things ready for entering upon his regimen the
next morning.</p>

<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Dec. 16.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">It is not to be imagined, how great an effect well-disposed
lights, with proper forms and orders in
assemblies, have upon some tempers. I am sure I feel
it in so extraordinary a manner, that I cannot in a day
or two get out of my imagination any very beautiful or
disagreeable impression which I receive on such occasions.
For this reason I frequently look in at the play-house, in
order to enlarge my thoughts, and warm my mind with
some new ideas, that may be serviceable to me in my
lucubrations. In this disposition I entered the theatre
the other day, and placed myself in a corner of it, very
convenient for seeing, without being myself observed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
I found the audience hushed in a very deep attention, and
did not question but some noble tragedy was just then in
its crisis, or that an incident was to be unravelled which
would determine the fate of a hero. While I was in
this suspense, expecting every moment to see my old
friend Mr. Betterton<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> appear in all the majesty of
distress, to my unspeakable amazement, there came up
a monster with a face between his feet; and as I was
looking on, he raised himself on one leg in such a
perpendicular posture, that the other grew in a direct
line above his head.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> It afterwards twisted itself into
the motions and wreathings of several different animals,
and after great variety of shapes and transformations,
went off the stage in the figure of a human creature.
The admiration, the applause, the satisfaction, of the
audience, during this strange entertainment, is not to be
expressed. I was very much out of countenance for my
dear countrymen, and looked about with some apprehension
for fear any foreigner should be present. Is it
possible, thought I, that human nature can rejoice in its
disgrace, and take pleasure in seeing its own figure
turned to ridicule, and distorted into forms that raise
horror and aversion? There is something disingenuous
and immoral in the being able to bear such a sight.
Men of elegant and noble minds are shocked at seeing
the characters of persons who deserve esteem for thei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>r
virtue, knowledge, or services to their country, placed in
wrong lights, and by misrepresentation made the subject
of buffoonery. Such a nice abhorrence is not indeed to
be found among the vulgar; but methinks it is wonderful,
that those who have nothing but the outward figure
to distinguish them as men, should delight in seeing it
abused, vilified, and disgraced.</p>

<p>I must confess, there is nothing that more pleases me
in all that I read in books, or see among mankind, than
such passages as represent human nature in its proper
dignity. As man is a creature made up of different extremes,
he has something in him very great and very
mean: a skilful artist may draw an excellent picture of
him in either of these views. The finest authors of antiquity
have taken him on the more advantageous side.
They cultivate the natural grandeur of the soul, raise in
her a generous ambition, feed her with hopes of immortality
and perfection, and do all they can to widen the
partition between the virtuous and the vicious, by making
the difference betwixt them as great as between gods and
brutes. In short, it is impossible to read a page in Plato,
Tully, and a thousand other ancient moralists, without
being a greater and a better man for it. On the contrary,
I could never read any of our modish French
authors, or those of our own country who are the imitators
and admirers of that trifling nation, without being
for some time out of humour with myself, and at everything
about me. Their business is to depreciate human
nature, and consider it under its worst appearances.
They give mean interpretations and base motives to the
worthiest actions: they resolve virtue and vice into constitution.
In short, they endeavour to make no distinction
between man and man, or between the species of
men and that of brutes. As an instance of this kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
authors, among many others, let any one examine the
celebrated Rochefoucault, who is the great philosopher
for administering of consolation to the idle, the envious,
and worthless part of mankind.</p>

<p>I remember a young gentleman of moderate understanding,
but great vivacity, who by dipping into many
authors of this nature, had got a little smattering of
knowledge, just enough to make an atheist or a free-thinker,
but not a philosopher or a man of sense. With
these accomplishments, he went to visit his father in the
country, who was a plain, rough, honest man, and wise,
though not learned. The son, who took all opportunities
to show his learning, began to establish a new religion
in the family, and to enlarge the narrowness of their
country notions; in which he succeeded so well, that he
had reduced the butler by his table-talk, and staggered
his eldest sister. The old gentleman began to be
alarmed at the schisms that arose among his children,
but did not yet believe his son's doctrine to be so pernicious
as it really was, till one day talking of his setting-dog,
the son said, he did not question but Tray was
as immortal as any one of the family; and in the heat
of the argument told his father, that for his own part he
expected to die like a dog. Upon which the old man,
starting up in a very great passion, cried out, "Then,
sirrah, you shall live like one;" and taking his cane in
his hand, cudgelled him out of his system. This had so
good an effect upon him, that he took up from that day,
fell to reading good books, and is now a Bencher in the
Middle Temple.</p>

<p>I do not mention this cudgelling part of the story
with a design to engage the secular arm in matters of
this nature; but certainly, if it ever exerts itself in affairs of
opinion and speculation, it ought to do it on such shallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
and despicable pretenders to knowledge, who endeavour
to give man dark and uncomfortable prospects of his
being, and destroy those principles which are the support,
happiness, and glory of all public societies, as well as
private persons.</p>

<p>I think it is one of Pythagoras's Golden Sayings, that a
man should take care above all things to have a due respect
for himself;<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and it is certain, that this licentious
sort of authors, who are for depreciating mankind, endeavour
to disappoint and undo what the most refined
spirits have been labouring to advance since the beginning
of the world. The very design of dress, good-breeding,
outward ornaments, and ceremony, were to lift up human
nature, and set it off to advantage. Architecture, painting,
and statuary were invented with the same design; as
indeed every art and science contributes to the embellishment
of life, and to the wearing off or throwing into
shades the mean or low parts of our nature. Poetry
carries on this great end more than all the rest, as may
be seen in the following passage, taken out of Sir Francis
Bacon's "Advancement of Learning,"<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> which gives a
truer and better account of this art than all the volumes
that were ever written upon it.</p>

<p>"Poetry, especially heroical, seems to be raised altogether
from a noble foundation, which makes much for
the dignity of man's nature. For seeing this sensible
world is in dignity inferior to the soul of man, poesy
seems to endow human nature with that which history
denies, and to give satisfaction to the mind, with at least
the shadow of things, where the substance cannot be had.
For if the matter be thoroughly considered, a strong
argument may be drawn from poesy, that a more stately
greatness of things, a more perfect order, and a mor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>e
beautiful variety, delights the soul of man, than any way
can be found in nature since the Fall. Wherefore seeing
the acts and events, which are the subject of true history,
are not of that amplitude as to content the mind of man;
poesy is ready at hand to feign acts more heroical. Because
true history reports the successes of business not
proportionable to the merit of virtues and vices, poesy
corrects it, and presents events and fortunes according to
desert, and according to the law of Providence. Because
true history, through the frequent satiety and similitude
of things, works a distaste and misprision in the mind of
man, poesy cheereth and refresheth the soul, chanting
things rare and various, and full of vicissitudes. So as
poesy serveth and conferreth to delectation, magnanimity,
and morality; and therefore it may seem deservedly to
have some participation of divineness, because it doth
raise the mind, and exalt the spirit with high raptures,
by proportioning the shows of things to the desires of
the mind; and not submitting the mind to things, as
reason and history do. And by these allurements and
congruities, whereby it cherisheth the soul of man, joined
also with consort of music, whereby it may more sweetly
insinuate itself; it hath won such access, that it hath
been in estimation even in rude times and barbarous
nations, when other learning stood excluded."</p>

<p>But there is nothing which favours and falls in with
this natural greatness and dignity of human nature so
much as religion, which does not only promise the entire
refinement of the mind, but the glorifying of the body,
and the immortality of both.</p>

<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Dec. 19.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">There has not some years been such a tumult in
our neighbourhood as this evening about six. At
the lower end of the lane the word was given, that there
was a great funeral coming by. The next moment came
forward in a very hasty, instead of a solemn manner, a
long train of lights, when at last a footman, in very high
youth and health, with all his force, ran through the
whole art of beating the door of the house next to me, and
ended his rattle with the true finishing rap. This did
not only bring one to the door at which he knocked, but
to that of every one in the lane in an instant. Among
the rest, my country maid took the alarm, and immediately
running to me, told me, there was a fine, fine lady,
who had three men with burial torches making way before
her, carried by two men upon poles, with looking-glasses
on each side of her, and one glass also before, she herself
appearing the prettiest that ever was. The girl was going
on in her story, when the lady was come to my door in
her chair, having mistaken the house. As soon as she
entered, I saw she was Mr. Isaac's<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> scholar by her speaking
air, and the becoming stop she made when she began
her apology. "You'll be surprised, sir," said she, "that
I take this liberty, who am utterly a stranger to you:
besides that it may be thought an indecorum that I visit
a man." She made here a pretty hesitation, and hel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>d
her fan to her face. Then, as if recovering her resolution,
she proceeded: "But I think you have said, that
men of your age are of no sex; therefore I may be as
free with you as one of my own." The lady did me the
honour to consult me on some particular matters, which
I am not at liberty to report. But before she took her
leave, she produced a long list of names, which she looked
upon to know whither she was to go next. I must confess,
I could hardly forbear discovering to her immediately,
that I secretly laughed at the fantastical regularity
she observed in throwing away her time; but I seemed
to indulge her in it, out of a curiosity to hear her own
sense of her way of life. "Mr. Bickerstaff," said she,
"you cannot imagine how much you are obliged to me
in staying thus long with you, having so many visits to
make; and indeed, if I had not hopes that a third part
of those I am going to will be abroad, I should be unable
to despatch them this evening." "Madam," said I, "are
you in all this haste and perplexity, and only going to
such as you have not a mind to see?" "Yes, sir," said
she, "I have several now with whom I keep a constant
correspondence, and return visit for visit punctually
every week, and yet we have not seen each other since
last November was twelvemonth."</p>

<p>She went on with a very good air, and, fixing her eyes
on her list, told me, she was obliged to ride about three
miles and a half before she arrived at her own house.
I asked after what manner this list was taken, whether
the persons wrote their names to her and desired that
favour, or how she knew she was not cheated in her
muster roll? "The method we take," says she, "is,
that the porter or servant who comes to the door, writes
down all the names who come to see us, and all such are
entitled to a return of their visit." "But," said I,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
"madam, I presume those who are searching for each
other, and know one another by messages, may be understood
as candidates only for each other's favour; and
that after so many howdees,<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> you proceed to visit or not,
as you like the run of each other's reputation or fortune."
"You understand it aright," said she, "and we become
friends as soon as we are convinced that our dislike to
each other may be of any consequence; for to tell you
truly," said she "(for it is in vain to hide anything from
a man of your penetration), general visits are not made
out of good-will, but for fear of ill-will. Punctuality in
this case is often a suspicious circumstance; and there is
nothing so common as to have a lady say, 'I hope she
has heard nothing of what I said of her, that she grows
so great with me.' But indeed, my porter is so dull and
negligent, that I fear he has not put down half the people
I owe visits to." "Madam," said I, "methinks it should
be very proper if your gentleman-usher or groom of the
chamber were always to keep an account by way of debtor
and creditor. I know a city lady who uses that method,
which I think very laudable; for though you may possibly
at the Court end of the town receive at the door, and
light up better than within Temple Bar, yet I must do
that justice to my friends the ladies within the walls to
own, that they are much more exact in their correspondence.
The lady I was going to mention as an example,
has always the second apprentice out of the counting-hous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>e
for her own use on her visiting day, and he sets down
very methodically all the visits which are made her. I
remember very well, that on the first of January last,
when she made up her account for the year 1708, it
stood thus:</p>



<div class="tdr">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="account">
<tr>
  <th class="tdc"> Mrs. <span class="smcap">Courtwood.</span></th>
  <th class="tdc"><i>Dr.</i></th>

  <th class="tdc"><i>Cr.</i></th>

  <td class="bl"></td>
  <td> 1704</td>
</tr>
</table></div>


<p>"This gentlewoman is a woman of great economy, and
was not afraid to go to the bottom of her affairs; and
therefore ordered her apprentice to give her credit for my
Lady Easy's impertinent visits upon wrong days, and
deduct only twelve per cent. He had orders also to
subtract one and a half from the whole of such as she
had denied herself to before she kept a day; and after
taking those proper articles of credit on her side, she was
in arrear but five hundred. She ordered her husband to
buy in a couple of fresh coach-horses; and with no other
loss than the death of two footmen, and a churchyard
cough brought upon her coachman, she was clear in the
world on the 10th of February last, and keeps so beforehand,
that she pays everybody their own, and yet makes
daily new acquaintances." I know not whether this
agreeable visitant was fired with the example of the lady
I told her of, but she immediately vanished out of my
sight, it being, it seems, as necessary a point of good-breeding,
to go off as if you stole something out of the
house, as it is to enter as if you came to fire it. I do not
know one thing that contributes so much to the lessening
the esteem men of sense have to the fair sex as this article
of visits. A young lady cannot be married, but all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
impertinents in town must be beating the tattoo from
one quarter of the town to the other, to show they know
what passes. If a man of honour should once in an age
marry a woman of merit for her intrinsic value, the
envious things are all in motion in an instant to make it
known to the sisterhood as an indiscretion, and publish
to the town how many pounds he might have had to have
been troubled with one of them. After they are tired
with that, the next thing is, to make their compliments
to the married couple and their relations. They are
equally busy at a funeral, and the death of a person of
quality is always attended with the murder of several sets
of coach-horses and chairmen. In both cases, the visitants
are wholly unaffected, either with joy or sorrow. For
which reason, their congratulations and condolences are
equally words of course; and one would be thought
wonderfully ill-bred, that should build upon such expressions
as encouragements, to expect from them any
instance of friendship.</p>

<p>Thus are the true causes of living, and the solid
pleasures of life, lost in show, imposture, and impertinence.
As for my part, I think most of the misfortunes
in families arise from the trifling way the women have
in spending their time, and gratifying only their eyes and
ears, instead of their reason and understanding.</p>

<p>A fine young woman, bred under a visiting mother,
knows all that is possible for her to be acquainted with
by report, and sees the virtuous and the vicious used so
indifferently, that the fears she is born with are abated,
and desires indulged, in proportion to her love of that
light and trifling conversation. I know I talk like an
old man; but I must go on to say, that I think the

young woman so false an idea of life, that she is generally
bred up with a scorn of that sort of merit in a

<p>Having received from the Society of Upholders sundry
complaints of the obstinate and refractory behaviour of
several dead persons, who have been guilty of very great
outrages and disorders, and by that means elapsed the
proper time of their interment; and having on the
other hand received many appeals from the aforesaid
dead persons, wherein they desire to be heard before
such their interment; I have set apart Wednesday the
21st instant, as an extraordinary court-day for the
hearing both parties. If therefore any one can allege
why they or any of their acquaintance should or should
not be buried, I desire they may be ready with their
witnesses at that time, or that they will for ever after
hold their tongues.</p>

<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Dec. 21.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">As soon as I had placed myself in my chair of judicature,
I ordered my clerk Mr. Lillie to read to the
assembly (who were gathered together according to
notice) a certain declaration, by way of charge, to ope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>n
the purpose of my session, which tended only to this
explanation, that as other courts were often called to
demand the execution of persons dead in law, so this
was held to give the last orders relating to those who
were dead in reason. The solicitor of the new Company
of Upholders near the Haymarket appeared in behalf of
that useful society, and brought in an accusation of a
young woman, who herself stood at the bar before me.
Mr. Lillie read her indictment, which was in substance,
that whereas Mrs. Rebecca Pindust, of the parish of
St. Martin's-in-the-Fields, had, by the use of one instrument,
called a looking-glass, and by the further
use of certain attire, made either of cambric, muslin, or
other linen wares, upon her head, attained to such an
evil art and magical force in the motion of her eyes and
turn of her countenance, that she the said Rebecca had
put to death several young men of the said parish; and
that the said young men had acknowledged in certain
papers, commonly called love letters (which were produced
in court, gilded on the edges, and sealed with a particular
wax, with certain amorous and enchanting words wrought
upon the said seals), that they died for the said Rebecca:
and whereas the said Rebecca persisted in the said evil
practice; this way of life the said society construed to
be, according to former edicts, a state of death, and
demanded an order for the interment of the said Rebecca.</p>

<p>I looked upon the maid with great humanity, and
desired her to make answer to what was said against her.
She said, it was indeed true that she had practised all
the arts and means she could to dispose of herself
happily in marriage, but thought she did not come under
the censure expressed in my writings for the same; and
humbly hoped, I would not condemn her for the
ignorance of her accusers, who, according to their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
words, had rather represented her killing than dead.
She further alleged, that the expressions mentioned in
the papers written to her, were become mere words, and
that she had been always ready to marry any of those
who said they died for her; but that they made their
escape as soon as they found themselves pitied or
believed. She ended her discourse by desiring I would
for the future settle the meaning of the words, "I die,"
in letters of love.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pindust behaved herself with such an air of
innocence, that she easily gained credit, and was acquitted.
Upon which occasion, I gave it as a standing rule, that
any persons who in any letter, billet, or discourse, should
tell a woman he died for her, should, if she pleased, be
obliged to live with her, or be immediately interred,
upon such their own confession, without bail or mainprize.</p>

<p>It happened, that the very next who was brought
before me was one of her admirers, who was indicted
upon that very head. A letter which he acknowledged
to be his own hand was read; in which were the following
words: "Cruel creature, I die for you." It was
observable, that he took snuff all the time his accusation
was reading. I asked him, how he came to use these
words, if he were not a dead man? He told me, he
was in love with the lady, and did not know any other
way of telling her so; and that all his acquaintance
took the same method. Though I was moved with
compassion towards him by reason of the weakness of his
parts, yet for example's sake, I was forced to answer,
"Your sentence shall be a warning to all the rest of
your companions, not to tell lies for want of wit."
Upon this, he began to beat his snuff-box with a very
saucy air; and opening it again, "Faith, Isaac," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
"thou art a very unaccountable old fellow&mdash;prithee,
who gave thee power of life and death? What a pox
hast thou to do with ladies and lovers? I suppose thou
wouldst have a man be in company with his mistress,
and say nothing to her. Dost thou call breaking a jest,
telling a lie? Ha! is that thy wisdom, old Stiffrump,
ha?" He was going on with this insipid commonplace
mirth, sometimes opening his box, sometimes shutting it,
then viewing the picture on the lid, and then the workmanship
of the hinge, when, in the midst of his eloquence,
I ordered his box to be taken from him; upon which he
was immediately struck speechless, and carried off stone
dead.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The next who appeared, was a hale old fellow of sixty.
He was brought in by his relations, who desired leave to
bury him. Upon requiring a distinct account of the
prisoner, a credible witness deposed, that he always rose
at ten of the clock, played with his cat till twelve, smoked
tobacco till one, was at dinner till two, then took another
pipe, played at backgammon till six, talked of one Madam
Frances, an old mistress of his, till eight, repeated the
same account at the tavern till ten, then returned home,
took another pipe, and then to bed. I asked him what he
had to say for himself. "As to what," said he, "they mention
concerning Madam Frances&mdash;" I did not care for
hearing a Canterbury tale, and therefore thought myself
seasonably interrupted by a young gentleman who appeared
in the behalf of the old man, and prayed an arrest
of judgment; for that he the said young man held certain
lands by his the said old man's life. Upon this, the
solicitor of the Upholders took an occasion to demand him
also, and thereupon produced several evidences that witnesse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>d
to his life and conversation. It appeared, that
each of them divided their hours in matters of equal
moment and importance to themselves and to the public.
They rose at the same hour: while the old man was playing
with his cat, the young one was looking out of his
window; while the old man was smoking his pipe, the
young man was rubbing his teeth; while one was at dinner,
the other was dressing; while one was at backgammon,
the other was at dinner; while the old fellow was talking
of Madam Frances, the young one was either at play, or
toasting women whom he never conversed with. The
only difference was, that the young man had never been
good for anything; the old man, a man of worth before
he knew Madam Frances. Upon the whole, I ordered
them to be both interred together, with inscriptions proper
to their characters, signifying, that the old man died in the
year 1689, and was buried in the year 1709. And over
the young one it was said, that he departed this world in
the twenty-fifth year of his death.</p>

<p>The next class of criminals were authors in prose and
verse. Those of them who had produced any still-born
work, were immediately dismissed to their burial, and
were followed by others, who, notwithstanding some
sprightly issue in their lifetime, had given proofs of their
death by some posthumous children, that bore no resemblance
to their elder brethren. As for those who were
the fathers of a mixed progeny, provided always they
could prove the last to be a live child, they escaped with
life, but not without loss of limbs; for in this case, I
was satisfied with amputation of the parts which were
mortified.</p>

<p>These were followed by a great crowd of superannuated
benchers of the Inns of Court, senior Fellows of colleges,
and defunct statesmen; all whom I ordered to be deci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>mated
indifferently, allowing the rest a reprieve for
one year, with a promise of a free pardon in case of
resuscitation.</p>

<p>There were still great multitudes to be examined; but
finding it very late, I adjourned the court; not without
the secret pleasure that I had done my duty, and furnished
out a handsome execution.</p>

<p>Going out of the court, I received a letter, informing
me, that in pursuance of the edict of justice in one of
my late visions, all those of the fair sex began to appear
pregnant who had run any hazard of it; as was manifest
by a particular swelling in the petticoats of several ladies
in and about this great city. I must confess, I do not
attribute the rising of this part of the dress to this occasion,
yet must own, that I am very much disposed to be
offended with such a new and unaccountable fashion. I
shall, however, pronounce nothing upon it till I have
examined all that can be said for and against it. And
in the meantime, think fit to give this notice to the fair
ladies who are now making up their winter suits, that
they may abstain from all dresses of that kind till they
shall find what judgment will be passed upon them; for
it would very much trouble me, that they should put
themselves to an unnecessary expense; and could not but
think myself to blame, if I should hereafter forbid them
the wearing of such garments, when they have laid out
money upon them, without having given them any previous
admonition.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

5th will be answered according to the desire of the party,
which he will see in few days.</p>

<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Dec. 23.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">The watchman, who does me particular honours, as
being the chief man in the lane, gave so very
great a thump at my door last night, that I awakened
at the knock, and heard myself complimented with the
usual salutation of "Good morrow, Mr. Bickerstaff;
good morrow, my masters all." The silence and darkness
of the night disposed me to be more than ordinarily
serious; and as my attention was not drawn out among
exterior objects by the avocations of sense, my thoughts
naturally fell upon myself. I was considering, amidst
the stillness of the night, what was the proper employment
of a thinking being? what were the perfections
it should propose to itself? and what the end it should
aim at? My mind is of such a particular cast, that the
falling of a shower of rain, or the whistling of wind, at
such a time, is apt to fill my thoughts with something
awful and solemn. I was in this disposition, when our
bellman began his midnight homily (which he has been
repeating to us every winter night for these twenty years)
with the usual exordium:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Oh! mortal man, thou that art born in sin!</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sentiments of this nature, which are in themselves just
and reasonable, however debased by the circumstances
that accompany them, do not fail to produce thei<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>r
natural effect in a mind that is not perverted and depraved
by wrong notions of gallantry, politeness, and
ridicule. The temper which I now found myself in,
as well as the time of the year, put me in mind of those
lines in Shakespeare, wherein, according to his agreeable
wildness of imagination, he has wrought a country
tradition into a beautiful piece of poetry. In the
tragedy of "Hamlet," where the ghost vanishes upon the
cock's crowing, he takes occasion to mention its crowing
all hours of the night about Christmas time, and to
insinuate a kind of religious veneration for that season.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>It faded on the crowing of the cock.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Some say, that ever 'gainst that season comes</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>This admirable author, as well as the best and greatest
men of all ages, and of all nations, seems to have had
his mind thoroughly seasoned with religion, as is evident
by many passages in his plays, that would not be suffered
by a modern audience; and are therefore certain instances,
that the age he lived in had a much greater sense of
virtue than the present.</p>

<p>It is indeed a melancholy reflection to consider, that
the British nation, which is now at a greater height of
glory for its counsels and conquests than it ever was
before, should distinguish itself by a certain looseness
of principles, and a falling off from those schemes of
thinking, which conduce to the happiness and perfection
of human nature. This evil comes upon us from th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>e
works of a few solemn blockheads, that meet together
with the zeal and seriousness of apostles, to extirpate
common-sense, and propagate infidelity. These are the
wretches, who, without any show of wit, learning, or
reason, publish their crude conceptions with an ambition
of appearing more wise than the rest of mankind, upon
no other pretence than that of dissenting from them.
One gets by heart a catalogue of title-pages and editions;
and immediately to become conspicuous, declares that he
is an unbeliever. Another knows how to write a receipt,
or cut up a dog, and forthwith argues against the immortality
of the soul. I have known many a little wit, in
the ostentation of his parts, rally the truth of the Scripture,
who was not able to read a chapter in it. These poor
wretches talk blasphemy for want of discourse, and are
rather the objects of scorn or pity, than of our indignation;
but the grave disputant, that reads and writes, and
spends all his time in convincing himself and the world
that he is no better than a brute, ought to be whipped
out of a government, as a blot to a civil society, and a
defamer of mankind. I love to consider an infidel,
whether distinguished by the title of deist, atheist, or
free-thinker, in three different lights, in his solitudes, his
afflictions, and his last moments.</p>

<p>A wise man that lives up to the principles of reason
and virtue, if one considers him in his solitude, as taking
in the system of the universe, observing the mutual
dependence and harmony by which the whole frame of
it hangs together, beating down his passions, or swelling
his thoughts with magnificent ideas of Providence,
makes a nobler figure in the eye of an intelligent being,
than the greatest conqueror amidst all the pomps and
solemnities of a triumph. On the contrary, there is not
a more ridiculous animal than an atheist in his retire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>ment.
His mind is incapable of rapture or elevation:
he can only consider himself as an insignificant figure in
a landscape, and wandering up and down in a field or a
meadow, under the same terms as the meanest animals
about him, and as subject to as total a mortality as they,
with this aggravation, that he is the only one amongst
them who lies under the apprehension of it.</p>

<p>In distresses, he must be of all creatures the most
helpless and forlorn; he feels the whole pressure of a
present calamity, without being relieved by the memory
of anything that is passed, or the prospect of anything
that is to come. Annihilation is the greatest blessing
that he proposes to himself, and a halter or a pistol the
only refuge he can fly to. But if you would behold one
of these gloomy miscreants in his poorest figure, you
must consider him under the terrors, or at the approach,
of death.</p>

<p>About thirty years ago I was a-shipboard with one of
these vermin, when there arose a brisk gale, which could
frighten nobody but himself. Upon the rolling of the
ship he fell upon his knees, and confessed to the chaplain,
that he had been a vile atheist, and had denied a Supreme
Being ever since he came to his estate. The good man
was astonished, and a report immediately ran through
the ship, that there was an atheist upon the upper deck.
Several of the common seamen, who had never heard the
word before, thought it had been some strange fish; but
they were more surprised when they saw it was a man,
and heard out of his own mouth, that he never believed
till that day that there was a God. As he lay in the
agonies of confession, one of the honest tars whispered to
the boatswain, that it would be a good deed to heave him
overboard. But we were now within sight of port, when
of a sudden the wind fell, and the penitent relapsed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
begging all of us that were present, as we were gentlemen,
not to say anything of what had passed.</p>

<p>He had not been ashore above two days, when one of
the company began to rally him upon his devotion on
shipboard, which the other denied in so high terms, that
it produced the lie on both sides, and ended in a duel.
The atheist was run through the body, and after some
loss of blood, became as good a Christian as he was at
sea, till he found that his wound was not mortal. He is
at present one of the free-thinkers of the age, and now
writing a pamphlet against several received opinions concerning
the existence of fairies.</p>

<p>As I have taken upon me to censure the faults of the
age and country which I live in, I should have thought
myself inexcusable to have passed over this crying one,
which is the subject of my present discourse. I shall
therefore from time to time give my countrymen particular
cautions against this distemper of the mind, that
is almost become fashionable, and by that means more
likely to spread. I have somewhere either read or heard
a very memorable sentence, that a man would be a most
insupportable monster, should he have the faults that are
incident to his years, constitution, profession, family,
religion, age, and country; and yet every man is in danger
of them all. For this reason, as I am an old man, I take
particular care to avoid being covetous, and telling long
stories. As I am choleric, I forbear not only swearing,
but all interjections of fretting, as "Pugh!" "Pish!" and
the like. As I am a layman, I resolve not to conceive an
aversion for a wise and a good man, because his coat is
of a different colour from mine. As I am descended of
the ancient family of the Bickerstaffs, I never call a man
of merit an upstart. As a Protestant, I do not suffer my
zeal so far to transport me, as to name the Pope and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
the devil together. As I am fallen into this degenerate
age, I guard myself particularly against the folly I have
been now speaking of. And as I am an Englishman, I
am very cautious not to hate a stranger, or despise a poor
Palatine.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Dec. 26.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">As I was looking over my letters this morning, I chanced
to cast my eye upon the following one, which came
to my hands about two months ago from an old friend
of mine, who, as I have since learned, was the person that
wrote the agreeable epistle inserted in my paper of the
third of the last month.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> It is of the same turn with the
other, and may be looked upon as a specimen of right
country letters.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sir,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"This sets out to you from my summer-house upon
the terrace, where I am enjoying a few hours' sunshine,
the scanty sweet remains of a fine autumn. The
year is almost at the lowest; so that in all appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>,
the rest of my letters between this and spring will be dated
from my parlour fire, where the little fond prattle of a
wife and children will so often break in upon the connection
of my thoughts, that you will easily discover it in
my style. If this winter should prove as severe as the
last, I can tell you beforehand, that I am likely to be a
very miserable man, through the perverse temper of my
eldest boy. When the frost was in its extremity, you
must know, that most of the blackbirds, robins, and
finches of the parish (whose music had entertained me
in the summer) took refuge under my roof. Upon this,
my care was, to rise every morning before day to set open
my windows for the reception of the cold and the hungry,
whom at the same time I relieved with a very plentiful
alms, by strewing corn and seeds upon the floors and
shelves. But Dicky, without any regard to the laws of
hospitality, considered the casements as so many traps,
and used every bird as a prisoner at discretion. Never
did tyrant exercise more various cruelties: some of the
poor creatures he chased to death about the room; others
he drove into the jaws of a bloodthirsty cat; and even
in his greatest acts of mercy, either clipped the wings, or
singed the tails, of his innocent captives. You will laugh,
when I tell you I sympathised with every bird in its misfortunes;
but I believe you will think me in the right
for bewailing the child's unlucky humour. On the other
hand, I am extremely pleased to see his younger brother
carry a universal benevolence towards everything that
has life. When he was between four and five years old,
I caught him weeping over a beautiful butterfly, which
he chanced to kill as he was playing with it; and I am
informed, that this morning he has given his brother
three halfpence (which was his whole estate) to spare the
life of a tomtit. These are at present the matters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
greatest moment within my observation, and I know are
too trifling to be communicated to any but so wise a man
as yourself, and from one who has the happiness to be,</p>

<p class="center">"Your most faithful,</p>
<p class="right">And most obedient Servant."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The best critic that ever wrote, speaking of some passages
in Homer which appear extravagant or frivolous,
says indeed that they are dreams, but the dreams of
Jupiter. My friend's letter appears to me in the same
light. One sees him in an idle hour; but at the same
time in the idle hour of a wise man. A great mind has
something in it too severe and forbidding, that is not
capable of giving itself such little relaxations, and of
condescending to these agreeable ways of trifling. Tully,
when he celebrates the friendship of Scipio and L&aelig;lius,<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
who were the greatest, as well as the politest, men of
their age, represents it as a beautiful passage in their retirement,
that they used to gather up shells on the seashore,
and amuse themselves with the variety of shape
and colour which they met with in those little unregarded
works of nature. The great Agesilaus could be a companion
to his own children, and was surprised by the
ambassadors of Sparta<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> as he was riding among them
upon a hobby-horse. Augustus indeed had no playfellows
of his own begetting; but is said to have passed
many of his hours with little Moorish boys at a game of
marbles, not unlike our modern taw. There is (methinks)
a pleasure in seeing great men thus fall into the rank o<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>f
mankind, and entertain themselves with diversions and
amusements that are agreeable to the very weakest of the
species. I must frankly confess, that it is to me a beauty
in Cato's character, that he would drink a cheerful bottle
with a friend; and I cannot but own, that I have seen
with great delight one of the most celebrated authors<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> of
the last age feeding the ducks in St. James's Park. By
instances of this nature, the heroes, the statesmen, the
philosophers, become as it were familiar with us, and
grow the more amiable the less they endeavour to appear
awful. A man who always acts in the severity of wisdom,
or the haughtiness of quality, seems to move in a personated
part: it looks too constrained and theatrical for
a man to be always in that character which distinguishes
him from others. Besides that, the slackening and unbending
our minds on some occasions, makes them exert
themselves with greater vigour and alacrity when they
return to their proper and natural state.</p>

<p>As this innocent way of passing a leisure hour is not
only consistent with a great character, but very graceful
in it, so there are two sorts of people to whom I would
most earnestly recommend it. The first are those who
are uneasy out of want of thought; the second are those
who are so out of a turbulence of spirit. The first are
the impertinent, and the second the dangerous part of
mankind.</p>

<p>It grieves me to the very heart when I see several
young gentlemen, descended of honest parents, run up
and down hurrying from one end of the town to th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>e
other, calling in at every place of resort, without being
able to fix a quarter of an hour in any, and in a particular
haste without knowing for what. It would (methinks)
be some consolation, if I could persuade these
precipitate young gentlemen to compose this restlessness
of mind, and apply themselves to any amusement, how
trivial soever, that might give them employment, and
keep them out of harm's way. They cannot imagine
how great a relief it would be to them if they could
grow sedate enough to play for two or three hours at a
game of pushpin. But these busy, idle animals are only
their own tormentors: the turbulent and dangerous are
for embroiling counsels, stirring up seditions, and subverting
constitutions, out of a mere restlessness of temper,
and an insensibility of all the pleasures of life that are
calm and innocent. It is impossible for a man to be so
much employed in any scene of action as to have great
and good affairs enough to fill up his whole time; there
will still be chasms and empty spaces, in which a working
mind will employ itself to its own prejudice, or that
of others, unless it can be at ease in the exercise of such
actions as are in themselves indifferent. How often have
I wished, for the good of the nation, that several famous
politicians could take any pleasure in feeding ducks. I
look upon an able statesman out of business like a huge
whale, that will endeavour to overturn the ship unless
he has an empty cask to play with.</p>

<p>But to return to my good friend and correspondent,
I am afraid we shall both be laughed at, when I confess,
that we have often gone out into the field to look
upon a bird's nest; and have more than once taken an
evening's walk together on purpose to see the sun
set. I shall conclude with my answer to his foregoing
letter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p class="drop-cap">"I thank you for your obliging letter, and your kindness
to the distressed, who will, doubtless, express
their gratitude to you themselves the next spring. As
for Dick the tyrant, I must desire you will put a stop to
his proceedings; and at the same time take care, that his
little brother be no loser by his mercy to the tomtit.
For my own part, I am excluded all conversation with
animals that delight only in a country life, and am therefore
forced to entertain myself as well as I can with my
little dog and cat. They both of them sit by my fire
every night, expecting my coming home with impatience;
and at my entrance, never fail of running up to me, and
bidding me welcome, each of them in his proper language.
As they have been bred up together from their infancy,
and seen no other company, they have learned each other's
manners, so that the dog often gives himself the airs of
a cat, and the cat, in several of her motions and gestures,
affects the behaviour of the little dog. When they are
at play, I often make one with them; and sometimes
please myself with considering, how much reason and
instinct are capable of delighting each other. Thus, you
see, I have communicated to you the material occurrences
in my family, with the same freedom that you use to
me; as I am with the same sincerity and affection,</p>

<p>"Your most faithful,</p>

<h3><i>Haymarket, Dec. 23.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">Whereas the gentleman that behaved himself in a very
disobedient and obstinate manner at his late trial
in Sheer Lane on the 20th instant,<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> and was carried off
dead upon the taking away of his snuff-box, remains still
unburied; the Company of Upholders not knowing otherwise
how they should be paid, have taken his goods in
execution to defray the charge of his funeral. His said
effects are to be exposed to sale by auction at their office
in the Haymarket on the 4th of January next, and are as
follow:</p>

<p>A very rich tweezer-case, containing twelve instruments
for the use of each hour in the day.</p>

<p>Four pounds of scented snuff, with three gilt snuff-boxes;
one of them with an invisible hinge, and a looking-glass
in the lid.</p>

<p>Two more of ivory, with the portraitures on their lids
of two ladies of the town; the originals to be seen every
night in the side-boxes<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> of the play-house.</p>

<p>A sword with a steel diamond hilt, never drawn but
once at May Fair.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>Six clean packs of cards, a quart of orange-flower water,
a pair of French scissors, a toothpick case, and an eyebrow
brush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<p>A large glass case, containing the linen and clothes of
the deceased; among which are, two embroidered suits,
a pocket perspective, a dozen pair of red-heeled shoes,
three pair of red silk stockings, and an amber-headed
cane.</p>

<p>The strong box of the deceased, wherein were found,
five billet-doux, a Bath shilling, a crooked sixpence, a silk
garter, a lock of hair, and three broken fans.</p>

<p>A press for books; containing on the upper shelf,</p>

<ul>
<li>Three bottles of diet-drink.</li>
<li>Two boxes of pills.</li>
<li>A syringe, and other mathematical instruments.</li></ul>


<p>On the second shelf are several miscellaneous
works; as,</p>

<ul>
<li>Lampoons.</li>
<li>Plays.</li>
<li>Tailors' bills.</li>
<li>And an almanac for the year 1700.</li></ul>


<p>On the third shelf,</p>

<ul>

<li>A bundle of letters unopened, endorsed (in the
hand of the deceased), "Letters from the old
gentleman."</li>

<li>Lessons for the flute.</li>



<li>Toland's "Christianity not Mysterious."<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>. And a
paper filled with patterns of several fashionable
stuffs.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the lowest shelf,</p>


<ul><li>One shoe.</li>
<li>A pair of snuffers.</li>
<li>A French grammar.</li>
<li>A mourning hat-band: and half a bottle of usquebaugh.</li>
</ul>
<hr class="chap" />


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>
<p>There will be added to these goods, to make a complete
auction, a collection of gold snuff-boxes and clouded
canes,<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> which are to continue in fashion for three months
after the sale.</p>

<p>The whole are to be set up and prized by Charles
Bubbleboy,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> who is to open the auction with a speech.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I find that I am so very unhappy, that while I am
busy in correcting the folly and vice of one sex, several
exorbitances break out in the other. I have not thoroughly
examined their new-fashioned petticoats, but shall set aside
one day in the next week for that purpose. The following
petition on this subject was presented to me this
morning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The humble Petition of <span class="smcap">William Jingle</span>, Coach-maker
and Chair-maker of the Liberty of Westminster.</p>

<p>"To <span class="smcap">Isaac Bickerstaff</span>, Esq., Censor of Great
Britain:</p>

<p>"Showeth&mdash;That upon the late invention of Mrs.
Catherine Cross-stitch, mantle-maker, the petticoats of
ladies were too wide for entering into any coach or chair
which was in use before the said invention.</p>

<p>"That for the service of the said ladies, your petitioner
has built a round chair, in the form of a lanthorn, six
yards and a half in circumference, with a stool in the
centre of it; the said vehicle being so contrived, as to
receive the passenger by opening in two in the middle,
and closing mathematically when she is seated.</p>

<p>"That your petitioner has also invented a coach fo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>r
the reception of one lady only, who is to be let in at
the top.</p>

<p>"That the said coach has been tried by a lady's woman
in one of these full petticoats, who was let down from a
balcony, and drawn up again by pulleys, to the great
satisfaction of her lady and all who beheld her.</p>

<p>"Your petitioner therefore most humbly prays, that
for the encouragement of ingenuity and useful inventions,
he may be heard before you pass sentence upon the petticoats
aforesaid.</p>

<p>
"And your petitioner, &amp;c."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have likewise received a female petition, signed by
several thousands, praying, that I would not any longer
defer giving judgment in the case of the petticoat, many
of them having put off the making new clothes till such
time as they know what verdict I will pass upon it. I do
therefore hereby certify to all whom it may concern, that
I do design to set apart Tuesday next for the final determination
of that matter, having already ordered a jury
of matrons to be impanelled, for the clearing up of any
difficult points that may arise in the trial.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Being informed, that several dead men in and about
this city do keep out of the way and abscond, for fear of
being buried; and being willing to respite their interment,
in consideration of their families, and in hopes of
their amendment, I shall allow them certain privileged
places, where they may appear to one another, without
causing any let or molestation to the living, or receiving
any in their own persons from the Company of Upholders.
Between the hours of seven and nine in the morning, they
may appear in safety at St. James's Coffee-house, or at
White's, if they do not keep their beds, which is more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
proper for men in their condition. From nine to eleven,
I allow them to walk from Story's to Rosamond's Pond<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
in the Park, or in any other public walks which are not
frequented by the living at that time. Between eleven
and three, they are to vanish, and keep out of sight till
three in the afternoon; at which time they may go to
'Change till five; and then, if they please, divert themselves
at the Haymarket, or Drury Lane, till the play
begins. It is further granted in favour of these persons,
that they may be received at any table where there are
more present than seven in number; provided, that they
do not take upon them to talk, judge, commend, or find
fault with any speech, action, or behaviour of the living.
In which case, it shall be lawful to seize their persons at
any place or hour whatsoever, and to convey their bodies
to the next undertakers; anything in this advertisement
to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

<h3><i>Sheer Lane, Dec. 30.</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap">I was walking about my chamber this morning in a
very gay humour, when I saw a coach stop at my
door, and a youth about fifteen alighting out of it,
whom I perceived to be the eldest son of my bosom
friend that I gave some account of in my paper of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>17th of the last month.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> I felt a sensible pleasure
rising in me at the sight of him, my acquaintance
having begun with his father when he was just such a
stripling, and about that very age. When he came up
to me, he took me by the hand, and burst out in tears.
I was extremely moved, and immediately said, "Child,
how does your father do?" He began to reply, "My
mother&mdash;" but could not go on for weeping. I went
down with him into the coach, and gathered out of
him, that his mother was then dying, and that while
the holy man was doing the last offices to her, he had
taken that time to come and call me to his father, who,
he said, would certainly break his heart if I did not go
and comfort him. The child's discretion in coming to
me of his own head, and the tenderness he showed for
his parents, would have quite overpowered me, had I
not resolved to fortify myself for the seasonable performances
of those duties which I owed to my friend.
As we were going, I could not but reflect upon the
character of that excellent woman, and the greatness
of his grief for the loss of one who has ever been the
support to him under all other afflictions. How,
thought I, will he be able to bear the hour of her death,
that could not, when I was lately with him, speak of a
sickness, which was then past, without sorrow. We were
now got pretty far into Westminster, and arrived at my
friend's house. At the door of it I met Favonius,<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> not
without a secret satisfaction to find he had been there.
I had formerly conversed with him at this house; and
as he abounds with that sort of virtue and knowledge
which makes religion beautiful, and never leads the
conversation into the violence and rage of party disputes,
I listened to him with great pleasure. Our discours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>e
chanced to be upon the subject of death, which he
treated with such a strength of reason, and greatness
of soul, that instead of being terrible, it appeared to a
mind rightly cultivated, altogether to be contemned, or
rather to be desired. As I met him at the door, I saw
in his face a certain glowing of grief and humanity,
heightened with an air of fortitude and resolution,
which, as I afterwards found, had such an irresistible
force, as to suspend the pains of the dying, and the lamentation
of the nearest friends who attended her. I went up
directly to the room where she lay, and was met at the
entrance by my friend, who, notwithstanding his thoughts
had been composed a little before at the sight of me,
turned away his face and wept. The little family of
children renewed the expressions of their sorrow according
to their several ages and degrees of understanding.
The eldest daughter was in tears, busied in attendance
upon her mother; others were kneeling about the bedside:
and what troubled me most was, to see a little boy,
who was too young to know the reason, weeping only
because his sisters did. The only one in the room who
seemed resigned and comforted, was the dying person.
At my approach to the bedside, she told me, with a low
broken voice, "This is kindly done. Take care of your
friend&mdash;don't go from him." She had before taken
leave of her husband and children, in a manner proper
for so solemn a parting, and with a gracefulness peculiar
to a woman of her character. My heart was torn in
pieces to see the husband on one side suppressing and
keeping down the swellings of his grief, for fear of disturbing
her in her last moments; and the wife even at
that time concealing the pains she endured, for fear of
increasing his affliction. She kept her eyes upon him for
some moments after she grew speechless, and soon after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
closed them for ever. In the moment of her departure,
my friend (who had thus far commanded himself) gave a
deep groan, and fell into a swoon by her bedside.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> The
distraction of the children, who thought they saw both
their parents expiring together, and now lying dead before
them, would have melted the hardest heart; but they
soon perceived their father recover, whom I helped to
remove into another room, with a resolution to accompany
him till the first pangs of his affliction were abated.
I knew consolation would now be impertinent; and therefore
contented myself to sit by him, and condole with
him in silence. For I shall here use the method of an
ancient author,<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> who, in one of his epistles relating the
virtues and death of Macrinus's wife, expresses himself
thus:<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> "I shall suspend my advice to this best of friends,
till he is made capable of receiving it by those three great
remedies (<i>necessitas ipsa</i>, <i>dies longa</i>, <i>et satietas doloris</i>) the
necessity of submission, length of time, and satiety of
grief."</p>

<p>In the meantime, I cannot but consider with much
commiseration, the melancholy state of one who has had
such a part of himself torn from him, and which he misses
in every circumstance of life. His condition is like that
of one who has lately lost his right arm, and is every
moment offering to help himself with it. He does not
appear to himself the same person in his house, at his
table, in company, or in retirement; and loses the relish
of all the pleasures and diversions that were before entertainin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>g
to him by her participation of them. The most
agreeable objects recall the sorrow for her with whom he
used to enjoy them. This additional satisfaction, from
the taste of pleasures in the society of one we love, is
admirably described in Milton, who represents Eve,
though in Paradise itself, no further pleased with the
beautiful objects around her than as she sees them in
company with Adam, in that passage so inexpressibly
charming.</p>

<p>The variety of images in this passage is infinitely pleasing,
and the recapitulation of each particular image, with
a little varying of the expression, makes one of the finest
turns of words that I have ever seen; which I rather
mention, because Mr. Dryden has said in his preface to
Juvenal, that he could meet with no turn of words in

<p>It may further be observed, that though the sweetness
of these verses has something in it of a pastoral, yet it
excels the ordinary kind, as much as the scene of it is
above an ordinary field or meadow. I might here, since
I am accidentally led into this subject, show several passages
in Milton that have as excellent turns of this nature
as any of our English poets whatsoever; but shall only
mention that which follows, in which he describes the
fallen angels engaged in the intricate disputes of predestination,
free-will, and foreknowledge; and to humour
the perplexity, makes a kind of labyrinth in the very
words that describe it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Others apart sat on a hill retired,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In thoughts more elevate, and reasoned high</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fixed fate, free-will, foreknowledge absolute,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And found no end in wandering mazes lost.</i><a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a><br /></span>

whose age had not arrived to that fineness, I found in him a true
sublimity, lofty thoughts which were clothed with admirable Grecisms,
and ancient words which he had been digging from the mines
of Chaucer and of Spenser, and which, with all their rusticity, had
somewhat of venerable in them. But I found not there neither that
for which I looked ['beautiful turns']." (Dryden's" Discourse on
Satire.")</p></div>
